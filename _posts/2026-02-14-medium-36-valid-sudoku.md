Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each **row** must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each **column** must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:** We are NOT solving Sudoku. Just validating the current board. Empty cells are represented by `'.'`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board = (same as above but with board[0][0] changed to "8")
Output: false
Explanation: Two 8's in the top-left 3x3 sub-box.
```

## Constraints

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`

## Thinking Process

**Fixed size 9x9** -- maximum 81 cells, so time complexity is essentially constant. This problem is not about performance; it's about **clean constraint modeling**.

We need to detect duplicates across **27 constraint groups**:
- 9 rows
- 9 columns
- 9 sub-boxes (3x3 blocks)

### Why Bitmask?

Instead of using `set` or `unordered_set`, use an integer bitmask per group:
- Faster -- no hash overhead
- Cleaner -- single integer per group
- Classic bit manipulation trick

### Encoding

For digit `d` (character `'1'` to `'9'`):

```
num = d - '1'       // 0..8
mask = 1 << num     // one-hot bit
```

Each row/col/box maintains an integer. If the bit is already set, we found a duplicate.

### Box Index: Why `(i/3)*3 + (j/3)` Works

The 9 sub-boxes are indexed as:

```
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8
```

- `(i / 3)` gives the block row (0, 1, or 2)
- `(j / 3)` gives the block column (0, 1, or 2)
- Combined: `(i / 3) * 3 + (j / 3)` maps to 0..8

Common wrong formula: `(i % 3) * 3 + (j % 3)` -- this gives position *within* a box, not the box index.

## Approach

Single pass over all 81 cells. For each filled cell:
1. Compute `num = board[i][j] - '1'` and `mask = 1 << num`
2. Compute `boxIndex = (i / 3) * 3 + (j / 3)`
3. Check if `mask` already exists in `row[i]`, `col[j]`, or `box[boxIndex]`
4. If yes, return `false`. Otherwise, set the bit.

**Time Complexity**: $O(81)$ = $O(1)$
**Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ (27 integers)

## Solution

{% raw %}
```python
class Solution:
def isValidSudoku(self, board):
    row[9] = :0
col[9] = :0
box[9] = :0
for (i = 0 i < 9 i += 1) :
for (j = 0 j < 9 j += 1) :
if (board[i][j] == '.') continue
num = board[i][j] - '1'   // 0..8
mask = 1 << num
boxIndex = (i / 3)  3 + (j / 3)
if (row[i] * mask) return False
if (col[j] * mask) return False
if (box[boxIndex] * mask) return False
row[i] |= mask
col[j] |= mask
box[boxIndex] |= mask
return True

```
{% endraw %}

## Common Mistakes

- Using `unordered_set` inside loops -- slower and messier than bitmask
- Forgetting to skip `'.'` cells
- Wrong box index formula (`(i % 3) * 3 + (j % 3)` is position within a box, not the box index)

## Key Takeaways

This problem tests:
- **Constraint modeling** -- 27 groups validated in one pass
- **Bitmask usage** -- one integer per constraint group
- **Grid indexing mapping** -- the `(i/3)*3 + (j/3)` trick
- **Clean $O(1)$ structure design** -- no containers, just arrays
