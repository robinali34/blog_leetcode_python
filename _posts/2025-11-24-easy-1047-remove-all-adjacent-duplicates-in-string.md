# [Easy] 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. A **duplicate removal** consists of choosing two **adjacent** and **equal** letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make **duplicate removals** on `s` until we no longer can.

Return *the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made*. It can be proven that the answer is **unique**.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation: 
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is "aaca" of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "azxxzy"
Output: "ay"
Explanation: 
First, we remove "xx" to get "azzy". Then we remove "zz" to get "ay".
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Duplicate removal**: What does "adjacent duplicates" mean? (Assumption: Two identical characters next to each other - "aa" is adjacent duplicates)

2. **Removal process**: How should we remove duplicates? (Assumption: Remove pairs of adjacent duplicates repeatedly until no more exist)

3. **Cascading removal**: Can removal cause new duplicates? (Assumption: Yes - removing "aa" from "baa" leaves "b", removing "aa" from "aab" leaves "b")

4. **Return format**: What should we return? (Assumption: Final string after all duplicate removals)

5. **Empty string**: What if string becomes empty? (Assumption: Return empty string "")

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to remove adjacent duplicates. Let me scan and remove pairs repeatedly."

**Naive Solution**: Repeatedly scan string, remove adjacent duplicate pairs, repeat until no more duplicates.

**Complexity**: O(n²) worst case, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- O(n²) time - multiple passes
- String manipulation is expensive
- Doesn't leverage stack structure
- Can be optimized

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can use stack to track characters. When duplicate found, pop from stack."

**Improved Solution**: Use stack. For each character, if matches stack top, pop; otherwise push. Stack naturally handles cascading removals.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- Stack handles cascading removals naturally
- O(n) time - single pass
- Clean and intuitive
- Can optimize space

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Can use string as stack or two pointers to optimize space."

**Best Solution**: Stack approach is optimal. Can use string as stack (modify in-place) or two pointers to simulate stack, reducing space.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n) space (can optimize to O(1) with two pointers)

**Key Realizations**:
1. Stack is perfect for matching/removal problems
2. O(n) time is optimal - single pass
3. Stack handles cascading removals elegantly
4. Space can be optimized with two pointers

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Stack-Based Solution

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Use a stack (or string as stack) to track characters. When encountering a character that matches the top of the stack, pop it. Otherwise, push the character.

### Approach 2: In-Place Two Pointers

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) excluding output space

Use two pointers to simulate a stack in-place. `left` acts as the stack pointer, `right` iterates through the string.

## Solution 1: Stack-Based (String as Stack)

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s):
        stk = []

        for ch in s:
            if stk and stk[-1] == ch:
                stk.pop()
            else:
                stk.append(ch)

        return "".join(stk)
```

## Solution 2: In-Place Two Pointers

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s):
        left = -1

        s = list(s)

        for right in range(len(s)):
            if left >= 0 and s[right] == s[left]:
                left -= 1
                continue

            left += 1
            s[left] = s[right]

        return "".join(s[:left + 1])
```

## How the Algorithms Work

### Stack-Based Approach

**Key Insight:** This problem is similar to matching parentheses. When we see a duplicate, we remove both characters (like popping from stack).

**Step-by-Step Example: `s = "abbaca"`**

```
Step | Char | Stack Before | Action | Stack After
-----|------|--------------|--------|-------------
0    | -    | ""           | Init   | ""
1    | 'a'  | ""           | Push   | "a"
2    | 'b'  | "a"          | Push   | "ab"
3    | 'b'  | "ab"         | Pop    | "a"  (b == b)
4    | 'a'  | "a"          | Pop    | ""   (a == a)
5    | 'c'  | ""           | Push   | "c"
6    | 'a'  | "c"          | Push   | "ca"

Result: "ca"
```

**Visual Representation:**
```
"abbaca"
  ↓
"a" → push 'a'
"ab" → push 'b'
"a" → pop 'b' (duplicate)
"" → pop 'a' (duplicate)
"c" → push 'c'
"ca" → push 'a'
```

### In-Place Two Pointers Approach

**Key Insight:** Use `left` as a stack pointer. When we find a duplicate, decrement `left` (simulating pop). Otherwise, increment `left` and assign (simulating push).

**Step-by-Step Example: `s = "abbaca"`**

```
Step | right | s[right] | left | s[0..left] | Action
-----|-------|----------|------|-------------|--------
0    | 0     | 'a'      | -1   | ""          | left=0, s[0]='a'
1    | 1     | 'b'      | 0    | "a"         | left=1, s[1]='b'
2    | 2     | 'b'      | 1    | "ab"        | left=0 (pop: b==b)
3    | 3     | 'a'      | 0    | "a"         | left=-1 (pop: a==a)
4    | 4     | 'c'      | -1   | ""          | left=0, s[0]='c'
5    | 5     | 'a'      | 0    | "c"         | left=1, s[1]='a'

Result: s.substr(0, 2) = "ca"
```

**Visual Representation:**
```
Initial: left = -1, right = 0
s = ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a']
      ↑
    right=0, left=-1 → left=0, s[0]='a'

s = ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a']
           ↑
    right=1, left=0 → left=1, s[1]='b'

s = ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a']
                ↑
    right=2, left=1, s[2]=='b'==s[1] → left=0 (pop)

s = ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a']
                     ↑
    right=3, left=0, s[3]=='a'==s[0] → left=-1 (pop)

s = ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a']
                          ↑
    right=4, left=-1 → left=0, s[0]='c'

s = ['a', 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a']
                               ↑
    right=5, left=0 → left=1, s[1]='a'

Final: s.substr(0, 2) = "ca"
```

## Key Insights

1. **Stack Pattern**: This is essentially a stack problem - matching adjacent pairs
2. **In-Place Optimization**: Can simulate stack using two pointers to save space
3. **Greedy Approach**: Remove duplicates as soon as we find them
4. **No Need for Multiple Passes**: Single pass is sufficient with proper data structure

## Algorithm Breakdown

### Stack-Based Solution

```python
str stk
for ch in s:
    if not not stk  and  stk[-1] == ch:
        stk.pop()  # Remove duplicate
         else :
        stk.append(ch)  # Add character
return stk

```

**How it works:**
1. Iterate through each character
2. If stack is not empty and top matches current character → pop (remove duplicate)
3. Otherwise → push current character
4. Return final stack contents

### In-Place Two Pointers Solution

```python
left = -1  # Stack pointer (points to last valid character)
for(right = 0 right < len(s) right += 1) :
if left >= 0  and  s[right] == s[left]:
    left -= 1  # Pop: move stack pointer back
    continue
s[left += 1] = s[right]  # Push: increment and assign
return s.substr(0, left + 1)

```

**How it works:**
1. `left` acts as stack pointer (points to last valid character)
2. `right` iterates through input string
3. If `left >= 0` and `s[right] == s[left]` → decrement `left` (pop)
4. Otherwise → increment `left` and assign `s[right]` (push)
5. Return substring from 0 to `left+1`

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty string**: Returns empty string
2. **All duplicates**: `"aaaa"` → `""`
3. **No duplicates**: `"abc"` → `"abc"`
4. **Nested duplicates**: `"abccba"` → `""`
5. **Single character**: `"a"` → `"a"`

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Stack (String)** | O(n) | O(n) | Simple, readable | Extra space |
| **In-Place Two Pointers** | O(n) | O(1) | Space efficient | Slightly more complex |

## Implementation Details

### Stack-Based: Why String Works

```python
str stk  # Acts as stack
stk[-1]    # Top of stack
stk.pop() # Pop from stack
stk.append() # Push to stack

```

**Why use string instead of stack<char>?**
- Easier to return result (no need to reverse)
- Same time complexity
- More memory efficient for this use case

### In-Place: Two Pointer Logic

```python
left = -1  # Points to last valid character (-1 means empty)
```

**Why `left = -1` initially?**
- Represents empty stack
- `left >= 0` check ensures stack is not empty before comparing
- `s[++left]` increments first, then assigns (pushes to stack)

**Why `continue` after decrementing?**
- Skip assigning current character (we've already "popped" it)
- Move to next character immediately

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 3: Using STL Stack

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s):
        stk = []

        for ch in s:
            if stk and stk[-1] == ch:
                stk.pop()
            else:
                stk.append(ch)

        result = ""

        while stk:
            result = stk[-1] + result
            stk.pop()

        return result
```

**Pros:**
- Explicit stack usage
- Clear intent

**Cons:**
- Need to reverse result
- More verbose

### Approach 4: Recursive Solution

**Time Complexity:** O(n²) worst case  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for recursion stack

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s):
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                return self.removeDuplicates(s[:i] + s[i + 2:])
        return s
```

**Pros:**
- Intuitive recursive thinking

**Cons:**
- Inefficient (creates new strings)
- Stack overflow risk for large inputs

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not handling empty stack**: Forgetting to check `!stk.empty()` before accessing top
2. **Wrong comparison**: Comparing with wrong character
3. **In-place index errors**: Off-by-one errors with `left` pointer
4. **Multiple passes**: Trying to do multiple passes instead of single pass
5. **Not using continue**: In in-place solution, forgetting `continue` after decrementing

## Optimization Tips

1. **Use string as stack**: More efficient than `stack<char>` for this problem
2. **In-place when possible**: Two-pointer approach saves space
3. **Early termination**: Can optimize if we know string length (not applicable here)

2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing adjacent duplicates in data streams
3. **Compression**: Basic run-length encoding preprocessing
4. **Parsing**: Removing redundant tokens in parsers

## Pattern Recognition

This problem demonstrates the **"Stack for Matching Pairs"** pattern:

```
1. Use stack to track elements
2. When encountering matching pair → pop
3. Otherwise → push
4. Return remaining stack contents
```

- Make The String Great
- Remove K Digits

## Why Stack Works

1. **LIFO Property**: Last character added is first to be matched
2. **Adjacent Matching**: Duplicates are always adjacent, matching stack's top
3. **Cascading Removals**: Removing one pair may create new adjacent pairs
4. **Single Pass**: Stack handles cascading removals in one pass

## In-Place Optimization Explanation

**Why it works:**
- `left` pointer simulates stack top
- `s[0..left]` represents current stack contents
- When duplicate found, decrement `left` (pop)
- When new character, increment `left` and assign (push)
- Final result is `s[0..left]`

**Space savings:**
- Stack approach: O(n) extra space
- In-place: O(1) extra space (reusing input string)

## Step-by-Step Trace: `s = "azxxzy"`

### Stack Approach:
```
'a' → push → stack: "a"
'z' → push → stack: "az"
'x' → push → stack: "azx"
'x' → pop  → stack: "az"  (x == x)
'z' → pop  → stack: "a"   (z == z)
'y' → push → stack: "ay"
Result: "ay"
```

### In-Place Approach:
```
right=0: 'a' → left=0, s[0]='a'
right=1: 'z' → left=1, s[1]='z'
right=2: 'x' → left=2, s[2]='x'
right=3: 'x' → left=1 (pop, x==x)
right=4: 'z' → left=0 (pop, z==z)
right=5: 'y' → left=1, s[1]='y'
Result: s.substr(0, 2) = "ay"
```

## Comparison: Stack vs In-Place

| Aspect | Stack | In-Place |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Readability** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Space** | O(n) | O(1) |
| **Time** | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Code Length** | Shorter | Slightly longer |
| **Best For** | Clarity | Space constraints |
