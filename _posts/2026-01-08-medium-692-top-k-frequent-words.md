# [Medium] 692. Top K Frequent Words

## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *most frequent strings*.

Return the answer **sorted by the frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 2
Output: ["the","is"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= words.length <= 500`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `k` is in the range `[1, The number of unique words[i]]`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Tie-breaking**: When words have the same frequency, how should we break ties? (Assumption: Sort lexicographically - alphabetical order)

2. **Frequency calculation**: How is frequency calculated? (Assumption: Count occurrences of each word in the input array)

3. **Case sensitivity**: Are word comparisons case-sensitive? (Assumption: Based on constraints, only lowercase letters, so case doesn't matter)

4. **Output format**: Should we return k words or all words with same frequency? (Assumption: Return exactly k words - top k most frequent)

5. **Word uniqueness**: Can the same word appear multiple times in result? (Assumption: No - each word appears once in the result, sorted by frequency then lexicographically)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to find top k frequent words. Let me count frequencies and sort."

**Naive Solution**: Count frequency of each word, sort by frequency (descending) then lexicographically, return top k.

**Complexity**: O(n log n) time, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- O(n log n) time when O(n log k) is possible
- Sorts all words when only need top k
- Doesn't leverage heap
- Can be optimized

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can use min-heap of size k to track top k words, with custom comparator."

**Improved Solution**: Count frequencies, use min-heap of size k with custom comparator (frequency then lexicographic). For each word, if heap size < k, add; else if word is more frequent or same frequency but lexicographically smaller, replace top.

**Complexity**: O(n log k) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- O(n log k) time is better than O(n log n)
- Heap efficiently maintains top k
- Custom comparator handles tie-breaking
- Can optimize further

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Min-heap with custom comparator is optimal. Sort result at end for correct order."

**Best Solution**: Min-heap approach is optimal. Count frequencies, use min-heap of size k. After processing, extract and sort heap elements for final result (frequency descending, then lexicographic).

**Complexity**: O(n log k) time, O(n) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Heap is perfect for top-k problems
2. Custom comparator handles tie-breaking
3. O(n log k) time is optimal for heap approach
4. Final sort ensures correct order

## Solution Approach

This problem is similar to [LC 347: Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/), but with two key differences:
1. **Strings instead of integers**: Need to handle string comparison
2. **Lexicographic ordering**: When frequencies are equal, sort alphabetically

### Key Insights:

1. **Frequency Counting**: Use hash map to count word frequencies
2. **Custom Sorting**: Sort by frequency (descending), then by lexicographic order (ascending)
3. **Top K Selection**: Return only the first k elements after sorting

### Algorithm:

1. **Count frequencies**: Use `unordered_map` to count occurrences of each word
2. **Collect unique words**: Extract all unique words from the map
3. **Sort**: Sort by frequency (descending), then lexicographically (ascending)
4. **Return top k**: Take first k elements

## Solution

### **Solution: Hash Map + Custom Sorting**

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words, k):
        cnt = {}

        for word in words:
            cnt[word] = cnt.get(word, 0) + 1

        rtn = list(cnt.keys())

        rtn.sort(key=lambda a: (-cnt[a], a))

        return rtn[:k]
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Count Frequencies (Lines 3-6)**:
   - Create `unordered_map<string, int>` to count word occurrences
   - Iterate through all words and increment their counts

2. **Collect Unique Words (Lines 7-10)**:
   - Extract all unique words (keys) from the frequency map
   - Store them in result vector `rtn`

3. **Custom Sort (Lines 11-13)**:
   - **Primary sort**: By frequency (descending) - `cnt[a] > cnt[b]`
   - **Secondary sort**: By lexicographic order (ascending) - `a < b` when frequencies are equal
   - Uses lambda with capture-by-reference `[&]` to access `cnt` map

4. **Return Top K (Lines 14-15)**:
   - Erase elements after index `k` to keep only top k
   - Return the result

### **Why This Works:**

- **Hash map counting**: Efficiently counts frequencies in O(n) time
- **Custom comparator**: Handles both frequency and lexicographic ordering
- **Sorting approach**: Simple and straightforward for small input sizes

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2`:**

```
Step 1: Count frequencies
cnt = {
    "i": 2,
    "love": 2,
    "leetcode": 1,
    "coding": 1
}

Step 2: Collect unique words
rtn = ["i", "love", "leetcode", "coding"]

Step 3: Sort with custom comparator
Compare pairs:
  - "i" vs "love": cnt["i"] == cnt["love"] (both 2) → "i" < "love" → "i" comes first
  - "leetcode" vs "coding": cnt["leetcode"] == cnt["coding"] (both 1) → "coding" < "leetcode" → "coding" comes first
  - "i"/"love" vs "leetcode"/"coding": cnt["i"] > cnt["leetcode"] → higher frequency comes first

After sorting:
rtn = ["i", "love", "coding", "leetcode"]

Step 4: Take top k = 2
rtn = ["i", "love"]

Result: ["i", "love"]
```

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m log m) where n is total words, m is unique words
  - O(n) for frequency counting
  - O(m) for collecting unique words
  - O(m log m) for sorting m unique words
  - O(k) for erasing (can be optimized to O(1) by using resize)
- **Space Complexity:** O(m) where m is number of unique words
  - O(m) for frequency map
  - O(m) for result vector

### **Optimization Note:**

Instead of `erase`, we could use `resize(k)` which is more efficient:
```python
rtn.resize(k)
return rtn
```

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 2: Min Heap (Better for Large k)**

For cases where k is much smaller than the number of unique words, a min heap approach would be more efficient:

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words, k):
        cnt = Counter(words)

        # heap stores (-freq, word) so it becomes max-frequency behavior
        pq = []

        for word, freq in cnt.items():
            heapq.heappush(pq, (-freq, word))

        rtn = []

        for _ in range(k):
            rtn.append(heapq.heappop(pq)[1])

        return rtn
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m log k) where m is unique words  
**Space Complexity:** O(m + k)

### **Approach 3: Bucket Sort**

Similar to LC 347, but requires additional sorting within each bucket:

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words, k):
        cnt = {}

        for word in words:
            cnt[word] = cnt.get(word, 0) + 1

        maxFreq = 0
        for word, freq in cnt.items():
            maxFreq = max(maxFreq, freq)

        buckets = [[] for _ in range(maxFreq + 1)]

        for word, freq in cnt.items():
            buckets[freq].append(word)

        rtn = []

        for i in range(maxFreq, 0, -1):
            if buckets[i]:
                buckets[i].sort()   # lexicographical order
                for word in buckets[i]:
                    rtn.append(word)
                    if len(rtn) == k:
                        return rtn

        return rtn
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m log m) in worst case  
**Space Complexity:** O(m)

## Key Insights

1. **Custom Comparator**: The key is the two-level sorting: frequency first, then lexicographic order
2. **Hash Map Efficiency**: `unordered_map` provides O(1) average case for frequency counting
3. **Sorting Trade-off**: Simple sorting works well for small inputs; heap is better for large k
4. **Lexicographic Order**: When frequencies are equal, use standard string comparison (`<`)

## Edge Cases

1. **All words have same frequency**: Sort purely by lexicographic order
2. **k equals number of unique words**: Return all words sorted
3. **Single word repeated**: Return that word
4. **Different frequencies, same lexicographic prefix**: Frequency takes priority
