# [Hard] 489. Robot Room Cleaner

Given a robot cleaner in a room modeled as a grid.

Each cell in the grid can be empty or blocked.

The robot cleaner with 4 given APIs can move forward, turn left or turn right. Each turn it made is 90 degrees.

When it tries to move into a blocked cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle and it stays on the current cell.

Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using only the 4 given APIs shown below.

```python
interface Robot :
// returns True if next cell is open and robot moves into the cell.
// returns False if next cell is blocked and robot stays in the current cell.
boolean move()
// Robot will stay in the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.
// Each turn will be 90 degrees.
void turnLeft()
void turnRight()
// Clean the current cell.
void clean()
```

**Note:**

- The input is only given to initialize the room and the robot's position internally. You must solve this problem "blindfolded". In other words, you must design the algorithm based only on the 4 given APIs and try it in the room first, then you may visualize the room layout.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
room = [
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
],
row = 1,
col = 3

Explanation:
All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or 1.
0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible.
The robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3.
From the top left corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.
```

## Constraints

- `m == room.length`
- `n == room[i].length`
- `1 <= m <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `room[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `0 <= row < m`
- `0 <= col < n`
- `room[row][col] == 1`
- All the empty cells can be visited from the starting position.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Robot operations**: What operations can the robot perform? (Assumption: move(), turnLeft(), turnRight(), clean() - can move forward, turn, and clean current cell)

2. **Room structure**: How is the room structured? (Assumption: Grid with walls (1) and empty cells (0) - robot starts at unknown position)

3. **Goal**: What are we trying to achieve? (Assumption: Clean all empty cells in the room using DFS backtracking)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Void - modify room state through clean() calls)

5. **Position tracking**: Can we track robot position? (Assumption: No - must use relative movement and backtracking to explore all cells)

## Interview Deduction Process (30 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (8 minutes)**

Use DFS to explore all reachable cells. For each cell, try all four directions. However, without knowing the room boundaries, we need to track visited cells to avoid infinite loops. The challenge is that we don't know the room layout, so we must explore systematically. Use a visited set to track cleaned cells and their coordinates relative to the starting position.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (10 minutes)**

Use DFS with backtracking: explore in one direction until hitting a wall, then backtrack and try other directions. Maintain a visited set using relative coordinates (since we don't know absolute coordinates). When hitting a wall, turn right (or use right-hand rule) to continue exploration. However, ensuring we visit all cells requires careful direction management and backtracking.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (12 minutes)**

Use DFS with relative coordinate tracking. Start at (0,0) relative to initial position. For each cell, mark as visited and cleaned. Try all four directions: if move() succeeds, recursively explore that cell, then backtrack by moving back and turning to maintain orientation. Use a visited set with relative coordinates. The key is proper backtracking: after exploring a direction, move back to maintain the robot's position, ensuring we can explore all reachable areas. This achieves optimal exploration of all reachable cells. The insight is that we need to maintain both position tracking (relative coordinates) and orientation tracking (current direction) to ensure complete exploration and proper backtracking.

## Solution: DFS Backtracking

**Time Complexity:** O(N - O) where N is number of cells and O is number of obstacles  
**Space Complexity:** O(N - O) for visited set and recursion stack

This solution uses DFS backtracking with a visited set to track cleaned cells. The key insight is to always return the robot to its previous position after exploring a path.

### Solution: DFS with Backtracking

```python
/
 // This is the robot's control interface.
 // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 class Robot:
     // Returns True if the cell in front is open and robot moves into the cell.
     // Returns False if the cell in front is blocked and robot stays in the current cell.
     bool move()
     // Robot will stay in the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.
     // Each turn will be 90 degrees.
     void turnLeft()
     void turnRight()
     // Clean the current cell.
     void clean()
/
class Solution:
list[list[int>> dirs = \:\:-1, 0\, \:0, 1\, \:1, 0\, \:0, -1\\
set<pair<int, int>> visited
def goBack(self, robot):
    robot.turnRight()
    robot.turnRight()
    robot.move()
    robot.turnRight()
    robot.turnRight()
def backtrack(self, robot, x, y, d):
    visited.insert(:x, y)
    robot.clean()
    for(i = 0 i < 4 i += 1) :
    new_d = (d + i) % 4
    nx = x + dirs[new_d][0]
    ny = y + dirs[new_d][1]
    if not visited.count({nx, ny})  and  robot.move():
        backtrack(robot, nx, ny, new_d)
        goBack(robot)
    robot.turnRight()
def cleanRoom(self, robot):
    backtrack(robot, 0, 0, 0)
```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Step-by-Step Example

```
Initial: Robot at (0,0), facing direction 0 (up)

Step 1: Clean (0,0) and mark visited
  Try direction 0 (up): Check (0-1,0) = (-1,0)
    Not visited, try move() → blocked or out of bounds
    Turn right → now facing direction 1 (right)
  
  Try direction 1 (right): Check (0,0+1) = (0,1)
    Not visited, try move() → success!
    Move to (0,1), call backtrack(robot, 0, 1, 1)
    
Step 2: At (0,1), facing direction 1 (right)
  Clean (0,1) and mark visited
  Try all 4 directions relative to current facing...
  
Step 3: After exploring (0,1), goBack() returns robot to (0,0)
  Turn right twice → facing opposite direction (left)
  Move → returns to (0,0)
  Turn right twice → facing original direction (up)
  
Step 4: Continue exploring other directions from (0,0)
```

### Visual Representation

```
Room Layout (1=accessible, 0=blocked):
  0 1 2 3 4
0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
2 1 0 1 1 1
3 0 0 0 1 0

Robot Path (starting at 1,3):
  Clean (1,3) → Explore all directions
    Move right → Clean (1,4)
    Move down → Clean (2,3)
    Move left → Clean (1,2)
    Move up → Clean (0,3)
    ... continue DFS until all cells cleaned
```

## Key Insights

1. **Relative Directions**: Use `(d + i) % 4` to explore directions relative to current facing
2. **Visited Set**: Track cleaned cells to avoid revisiting
3. **Backtracking**: Always return robot to previous position after exploring
4. **goBack Function**: Turn 180°, move, turn 180° to return to previous cell
5. **Direction Array**: `dirs = \{\{-1,0\}, \{0,1\}, \{1,0\}, \{0,-1\}\}` represents [up, right, down, left]

## Algorithm Breakdown

### Direction Management

```python
list[list[int>> dirs = \:\:-1, 0\, \:0, 1\, \:1, 0\, \:0, -1\\
// Index: 0=up, 1=right, 2=down, 3=left
new_d = (d + i) % 4  // Relative direction
nx = x + dirs[new_d][0]
ny = y + dirs[new_d][1]
```

**Why relative directions?**
- Robot maintains its facing direction
- `(d + i) % 4` rotates relative to current facing
- `i=0`: same direction, `i=1`: right turn, `i=2`: 180°, `i=3`: left turn

### Backtracking Function

```python
def backtrack(self, robot, x, y, d):
    // Mark current cell as visited and clean
    visited.insert(:x, y)
    robot.clean()
    // Try all 4 directions
    for(i = 0 i < 4 i += 1) :
    new_d = (d + i) % 4
    nx = x + dirs[new_d][0]
    ny = y + dirs[new_d][1]
    // If not visited and can move
    if not visited.count({nx, ny})  and  robot.move():
        // Explore recursively
        backtrack(robot, nx, ny, new_d)
        // Return to current position
        goBack(robot)
    // Turn right to try next direction
    robot.turnRight()
```

### goBack Function

```python
def goBack(self, robot):
    robot.turnRight()  // Turn 90° right
    robot.turnRight()  // Turn 90° right (total 180°)
    robot.move()       // Move back to previous cell
    robot.turnRight()  // Turn 90° right
    robot.turnRight()  // Turn 90° right (total 180°, restore original facing)
```

**Why this works:**
- After `backtrack` returns, robot is facing away from previous cell
- Turn 180° to face previous cell
- Move back
- Turn 180° to restore original facing direction

## Edge Cases

1. **Single cell room**: Only one accessible cell → clean and return
2. **All directions blocked**: Clean current cell, no recursion
3. **Dead ends**: Backtrack correctly handles dead ends
4. **Circular paths**: Visited set prevents infinite loops
5. **Large room**: DFS handles any size room efficiently

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 2: Explicit Direction Tracking

**Time Complexity:** O(N - O)  
**Space Complexity:** O(N - O)

More explicit direction management:

```python
class Solution:
set<pair<int, int>> visited
list[list[int>> dirs = \:\:-1,0\, \:0,1\, \:1,0\, \:0,-1\\
def goBack(self, robot):
    robot.turnRight()
    robot.turnRight()
    robot.move()
    robot.turnRight()
    robot.turnRight()
def dfs(self, robot, x, y, dir):
    visited.insert(:x, y)
    robot.clean()
    for(i = 0 i < 4 i += 1) :
    newDir = (dir + i) % 4
    nx = x + dirs[newDir][0]
    ny = y + dirs[newDir][1]
    if visited.find({nx, ny}) == visited.end()  and  robot.move():
        dfs(robot, nx, ny, newDir)
        goBack(robot)
    robot.turnRight()
def cleanRoom(self, robot):
    dfs(robot, 0, 0, 0)
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **DFS Backtracking** | O(N-O) | O(N-O) | Simple, intuitive | Requires backtracking logic |
| **Explicit Tracking** | O(N-O) | O(N-O) | Clear direction handling | Same complexity |

## Implementation Details

### Direction Array

```python
list[list[int>> dirs = \:\:-1, 0\, \:0, 1\, \:1, 0\, \:0, -1\\
//                    Index:   0        1       2        3
//                  Meaning:  up     right   down     left
```

**Why this order?**
- Matches clockwise rotation: up → right → down → left
- `turnRight()` increments direction index
- `(d + i) % 4` rotates relative to current facing

### Visited Set

```python
set<pair<int, int>> visited
```

**Why use set?**
- O(log n) lookup and insertion
- Prevents revisiting cleaned cells
- Tracks all cleaned positions

### Relative Direction Calculation

```python
new_d = (d + i) % 4
```

**How it works:**
- `d`: Current facing direction (0=up, 1=right, 2=down, 3=left)
- `i`: Offset (0=same, 1=right turn, 2=180°, 3=left turn)
- `(d + i) % 4`: New direction after turning right `i` times

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting goBack**: Not returning robot to previous position
2. **Wrong direction calculation**: Not using relative directions
3. **Not tracking visited**: Infinite recursion or revisiting cells
4. **Wrong turn sequence**: Incorrect goBack implementation
5. **Not cleaning current cell**: Forgetting to call `robot.clean()`

## Optimization Tips

1. **Use unordered_set**: Can use `unordered_set<pair<int,int>>` with hash for O(1) lookup
2. **Direction optimization**: Pre-compute direction offsets
3. **Early termination**: Can optimize if we know room size (not applicable here)

## Pattern Recognition

This problem demonstrates the **"DFS Backtracking with State Restoration"** pattern:

```
1. Mark current state (visited, clean)
2. Explore all possible next states
3. Recursively process each valid next state
4. Restore previous state (goBack)
5. Continue with next option
```

## Why Backtracking is Necessary

1. **Robot State**: Robot maintains position and facing direction
2. **API Constraints**: Can only move forward, must turn to change direction
3. **Exploration Order**: Need to try all directions from each cell
4. **State Restoration**: Must return robot to previous position after exploring

## goBack Function Explanation

```python
def goBack(self, robot):
    robot.turnRight()  // 1st turn: 90° right
    robot.turnRight()  // 2nd turn: 90° right (total 180°)
    robot.move()       // Move back to previous cell
    robot.turnRight()  // 3rd turn: 90° right
    robot.turnRight()  // 4th turn: 90° right (total 180°, restore facing)
```

**Step-by-step:**
1. After recursive call returns, robot faces away from previous cell
2. Turn 180° to face previous cell
3. Move back to previous cell
4. Turn 180° to restore original facing direction

## Direction Index Mapping

```
Direction Index → Movement Offset
0 (up)    → (-1, 0)
1 (right) → (0, 1)
2 (down)  → (1, 0)
3 (left)  → (0, -1)

Turning right increments index: (d + 1) % 4
Turning left decrements index: (d + 3) % 4
```

## Coordinate System

- **Origin (0,0)**: Starting position of robot
- **Relative coordinates**: All positions relative to start
- **No absolute grid**: We don't know room boundaries
- **Visited tracking**: Only way to know what's been explored
