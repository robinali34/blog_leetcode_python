# 210. Course Schedule II

## Problem Statement

You have `numCourses` courses labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` means you must take course `bi` before course `ai`. Return any valid ordering of courses to finish all of them, or an empty array if it is impossible.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: To take course 1 you must take course 0 first. So [0,1] is valid.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3] (or [0,1,2,3], etc.)
Explanation: 0 has no prereq; 1 and 2 depend on 0; 3 depends on 1 and 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- `ai != bi`; all pairs are distinct

## Solution Approach

This is **topological sort** on a directed graph: edge `(bi, ai)` means `bi` must come before `ai`. If the graph has a cycle, no valid order exists. Two standard approaches:

1. **DFS + three-state coloring:** 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting (on stack), 2 = visited. If we see a node with color 1 while DFS, there is a cycle. When we finish a node (color 2), append it to a list; reverse the list to get topological order.
2. **Kahn's algorithm (BFS):** Compute indegree of each node. Repeatedly take a node with indegree 0, add it to the order, and decrease indegree of its neighbors. If the final order has size `numCourses`, no cycle; else return `[]`.

## Solution 1: DFS with Three-State Coloring

```python
class Solution:
def findOrder(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
    list[list[int>> adj(numCourses)
    list[int> color(numCourses, 0) // 0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited
    list[int> order
    bool valid = True
    for p in prerequisites:
        adj[p[1]].emplace_back(p[0])
    for (i = 0 i < numCourses i += 1) :
    if color[i] == 0) dfs(i, adj, color, order, valid:
if (not valid) return :
order.reverse()
return order
def dfs(self, u, adj, color, order, valid):
    color[u] = 1
    for v in adj[u]:
        if color[v] == 0:
            dfs(v, adj, color, order, valid)
            if (not valid) return
             else if (color[v] == 1) :
            valid = False
            return
    color[u] = 2
    order.emplace_back(u)
```

- **Cycle:** Seeing `color[v] == 1` means `v` is on the current DFS stack → back edge → cycle.
- **Order:** We push a node when we finish it (all descendants done), so the list is **reverse** topological order; one reverse gives a valid order.
- **Time:** O(V + E). **Space:** O(V).

## Solution 2: Kahn's Algorithm (BFS)

```python
class Solution:
def findOrder(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
    list[list[int>> adj(numCourses)
    list[int> indegree(numCourses, 0)
    deque[int> q
    list[int> order
    for p in prerequisites:
        adj[p[1]].emplace_back(p[0])
        indegree[p[0]]++
    for (i = 0 i < numCourses i += 1) :
    if indegree[i] == 0) q.push(i:
while not not q:
    u = q[0]
    q.pop()
    order.emplace_back(u)
    for v in adj[u]:
        if indegree -= 1[v] == 0) q.push(v:
(order if         return len(order) == numCourses  else list[int>:)
```

- **Indegree:** `indegree[v]` = number of edges into `v`. Process nodes with indegree 0 (no unmet prerequisites).
- **Cycle:** If there is a cycle, some nodes never get indegree 0, so `order.size() < numCourses` → return `[]`.
- **Time:** O(V + E). **Space:** O(V).

## Comparison

| Approach        | Idea                    | Cycle check              |
|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| DFS + coloring | Finish order → reverse  | Back edge (color == 1)    |
| Kahn (BFS)     | Indegree 0 → order      | order.size() != numCourses |

## Key Insights

1. **Prerequisite = edge:** `[a, b]` means `b → a` in the graph; topological order has predecessors before successors.
2. **DFS order:** Finishing order is reverse topological; one reverse gives a valid schedule.
3. **Kahn:** No need to reverse; order is built in topological order as we dequeue.
