You are given an array of `k` linked lists, each sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked lists into one sorted linked list and return it.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: lists = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
```

## Constraints

- `k == lists.length`
- `0 <= k <= 10^4`
- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
- `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
- `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order
- The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`

## Thinking Process

Let `k` = number of lists, `N` = total number of nodes.

**Lower bound**: We must touch every node, so $\Omega(N)$.

### Why Sequential Merge Is Bad

If you merge one-by-one:

```
res = merge(lists[0], lists[1])
res = merge(res, lists[2])
res = merge(res, lists[3])
...
```

Worst case time is roughly $N + 2N + 3N + \cdots \approx O(kN)$. This TLEs when `k` is large because earlier merged results keep getting re-traversed.

### Balanced Merging

This is exactly like merge sort -- tree height is $\log k$. Each level processes all $N$ nodes once, so:

$$\text{Time} = O(N \log k)$$

### Why This Is $\log k$

Each round halves the number of lists:

```
k → k/2 → k/4 → k/8 → ... → 1
```

Number of rounds: $\log_2 k$. Each round processes all nodes once. Total: $N \cdot \log k$.

## Approach: Divide & Conquer -- $O(N \log k)$

Pair lists and merge them in rounds, halving the count each time. This avoids the repeated long traversals of sequential merging.

{% raw %}
```python
class Solution:
def mergeTwo(self, a, b):
dummy = ListNode(0)
tail = dummy
while a and b:
if a.val < b.val:
tail.next = a
a = a.next
else:
tail.next = b
b = b.next
tail = tail.next
tail.next = a if a else b
return dummy.next
def mergeKLists(self, lists):
if not lists:
return None
n = len(lists)
step = 1
while step < n:
for i in range(0, n - step, step  2):
lists[i] = self.mergeTwo(lists[i], lists[i + step])
step = 2
return lists[0]
```
{% endraw %}

**Time**: $O(N \log k)$
**Space**: $O(1)$ extra (iterative, in-place pointer rewiring)

## Alternative: Min Heap (Priority Queue) -- $O(N \log k)$

Also optimal at $O(N \log k)$, but with $O(k)$ extra space for the heap.

**How it works:**

1. **Initialize** -- push the head of each non-empty list into a min-heap (size at most `k`)
2. **Pop** the smallest node from the heap and append it to the result
3. **Push** that node's `next` into the heap (if it exists)
4. Repeat until the heap is empty

The heap always holds at most one node per list, so each push/pop is $O(\log k)$. Over all $N$ nodes, total time is $O(N \log k)$.

**Why use a custom comparator struct?** Defining `Compare` as a struct makes the comparator reusable and avoids lambda overhead. The `priority_queue` in C++ is a max-heap by default, so we reverse the comparison (`a->val > b->val`) to get min-heap behavior.

{% raw %}
```python
import heapq
class Solution:
def mergeKLists(self, lists):
heap = []
for i, node in enumerate(lists):
if node:
heapq.heappush(heap, (node.val, i, node))
dummy = ListNode(0)
tail = dummy
while heap:
_, i, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
tail.next = node
tail = tail.next
if node.next:
heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, i, node.next))
return dummy.next
```
{% endraw %}

**Time**: $O(N \log k)$ -- each of $N$ nodes is pushed/popped once, each operation $O(\log k)$
**Space**: $O(k)$ for the heap

## What Strong Candidates Notice

- `k` may be large with small lists, or `k` small with very large lists -- balanced merging handles both
- Divide & conquer uses $O(1)$ extra space vs $O(k)$ for the heap
- Sequential merge degrades to $O(kN)$ -- always avoid it

## Edge Cases

- `k = 0` -- return `None`
- Some lists are empty -- skip them
- All lists are empty -- return `None`
- Single list -- return it directly

## Key Takeaways

When you see **"merge k sorted ..."**, immediately think:
- **Multi-way merge** via min heap
- **Divide & conquer** tree merging

This is a pattern problem. Balanced merging prevents repeated long traversals, bringing complexity from $O(kN)$ down to $O(N \log k)$.
