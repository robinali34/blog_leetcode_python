# [Medium] 279. Perfect Squares

Given an integer `n`, return *the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to* `n`.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Perfect square definition**: What is a perfect square? (Assumption: A number that is the square of an integer - 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc.)

2. **Sum requirement**: Can we use the same perfect square multiple times? (Assumption: Yes - can reuse perfect squares, e.g., 4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)

3. **Optimization goal**: What are we optimizing for? (Assumption: Minimize the number of perfect squares that sum to n)

4. **All squares available**: Can we use any perfect square? (Assumption: Yes - can use any perfect square up to n)

5. **Return value**: What should we return - count or list of squares? (Assumption: Return the minimum count - integer representing least number of perfect squares)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to find minimum perfect squares. Let me try all possible combinations."

**Naive Solution**: Recursively try all combinations of perfect squares that sum to n, return minimum count.

**Complexity**: O(√n^n) worst case time, O(√n) space

**Issues**:
- Exponential time complexity
- Tries many redundant combinations
- Very inefficient for large n
- Doesn't leverage optimal substructure

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "This is similar to coin change. I can use dynamic programming."

**Improved Solution**: DP where dp[i] = minimum perfect squares needed for i. For each i, try all perfect squares ≤ i and take minimum.

**Complexity**: O(n × √n) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- Polynomial time instead of exponential
- Correctly finds minimum
- Much more efficient than brute-force
- Can be optimized further

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "DP is good, but can also use BFS for shortest path or mathematical theorem for some cases."

**Best Solution**: DP approach is optimal for general case. Can also use BFS treating as shortest path problem, or Legendre's theorem for mathematical optimization in some cases.

**Complexity**: O(n × √n) time, O(n) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. DP is natural approach - similar to coin change
2. O(n × √n) time is reasonable for n ≤ 10^4
3. BFS alternative treats it as graph shortest path
4. Mathematical theorems can optimize but DP is more general

## Solution 1: Mathematical Approach (Legendre's Theorem) - Recommended

**Time Complexity:** O(√n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

This solution uses **Legendre's three-square theorem** and **Lagrange's four-square theorem** to determine the minimum number of perfect squares needed.

```python
class Solution:
def isSquare(self, n):
    sq = (int) sqrt(n)
    return n == sq  sq
def numSquares(self, n):
    // Reduce n by removing factors of 4
    while n % 4 == 0:
        n /= 4
    // Legendre's three-square theorem: n = 4^a(8b + 7)
    // If n ≡ 7 (mod 8), then n requires 4 squares
    if n % 8 == 7:
        return 4
    // Check if n is a perfect square (requires 1 square)
    if isSquare(n):
        return 1
    // Check if n can be expressed as sum of 2 squares
    for(i = 1 i  i <= n i += 1) :
    if isSquare(n - i * i):
        return 2
// Otherwise, requires 3 squares (Legendre's theorem)
return 3
```

### How Solution 1 Works

1. **Reduce by factors of 4**: 
   - If `n = 4^a × m`, then `numSquares(n) = numSquares(m)`
   - This optimization reduces the problem size

2. **Check for 4 squares** (Legendre's three-square theorem):
   - If `n ≡ 7 (mod 8)`, then `n` requires exactly 4 perfect squares
   - This is a necessary and sufficient condition

3. **Check for 1 square**:
   - If `n` is a perfect square, return 1

4. **Check for 2 squares**:
   - Try all possible `i` such that `i² ≤ n`
   - Check if `n - i²` is also a perfect square
   - If yes, return 2

5. **Otherwise, return 3**:
   - By Legendre's theorem, any number not covered above requires 3 squares

### Mathematical Background

**Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem**: Every natural number can be represented as the sum of four integer squares.

**Legendre's Three-Square Theorem**: A natural number can be expressed as the sum of three squares if and only if it is not of the form `4^a(8b + 7)` for nonnegative integers `a` and `b`.

**Two-Square Theorem**: A number can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if in its prime factorization, every prime of the form `4k + 3` occurs with an even exponent.

## Solution 2: Dynamic Programming

**Time Complexity:** O(n × √n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Bottom-up DP approach similar to coin change problem.

```python
class Solution:
def numSquares(self, n):
    list[int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX)
    dp[0] = 0
    // Generate all perfect squares up to n
    list[int> squares
    for(i = 1 i  i <= n i += 1) :
    squares.append(i  i)
// Fill DP array
for(i = 1 i <= n i += 1) :
for sq in squares:
    if(sq > i) break
    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - sq] + 1)
return dp[n]
```

### How Solution 2 Works

1. **DP array**: `dp[i]` = minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `i`
2. **Base case**: `dp[0] = 0` (0 squares needed for 0)
3. **Transition**: For each `i`, try all perfect squares `sq ≤ i`
   - `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - sq] + 1)`
4. **Result**: `dp[n]` contains the answer

### Example Walkthrough (DP)

**n = 12:**
```
Squares: [1, 4, 9]

dp[0] = 0
dp[1] = min(∞, dp[0] + 1) = 1
dp[2] = min(∞, dp[1] + 1) = 2
dp[3] = min(∞, dp[2] + 1) = 3
dp[4] = min(∞, dp[0] + 1, dp[3] + 1) = min(∞, 1, 4) = 1
dp[5] = min(∞, dp[4] + 1, dp[1] + 1) = min(∞, 2, 2) = 2
...
dp[12] = min(∞, dp[11] + 1, dp[8] + 1, dp[3] + 1) = min(∞, 4, 3, 4) = 3
```

## Solution 3: BFS (Shortest Path)

**Time Complexity:** O(n × √n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Treat as a graph problem where we find the shortest path from `n` to `0`.

```python
class Solution:
def numSquares(self, n):
    deque[int> q
    set[int> visited
    q.push(n)
    visited.insert(n)
    level = 0
    while not not q:
        size = len(q)
        level += 1
        while size -= 1:
            curr = q[0]
            q.pop()
            // Try subtracting each perfect square
            for(i = 1 i  i <= curr i += 1) :
            next = curr - i  i
            if next == 0:
                return level
            if visited.find(next) == visited.end():
                visited.insert(next)
                q.push(next)
return level
```

### How Solution 3 Works

1. **Graph representation**: 
   - Nodes: integers from `n` down to `0`
   - Edges: subtract a perfect square to move to next node
   - Goal: reach `0` in minimum steps

2. **BFS traversal**:
   - Start from `n`
   - At each level, subtract all possible perfect squares
   - First time we reach `0`, return the level (number of squares)

3. **Visited tracking**: Avoid revisiting the same number

## Solution 4: Optimized DP (Static Squares)

**Time Complexity:** O(n × √n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Pre-compute perfect squares and use static array for better performance.

```python
class Solution:
def numSquares(self, n):
    static list[int> dp(1, 0)
    while len(dp) <= n:
        m = len(dp)
        minSquares = INT_MAX
        for(i = 1 i  i <= m i += 1) :
        minSquares = min(minSquares, dp[m - i  i] + 1)
    dp.append(minSquares)
return dp[n]
```

### How Solution 4 Works

- **Static DP array**: Reuses computation across multiple test cases
- **Incremental building**: Only computes values up to `n` if needed
- **Efficient**: Better for multiple queries

## Comparison of Approaches

| Aspect | Mathematical | DP | BFS | Optimized DP |
|--------|--------------|----|----|--------------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(√n) | O(n×√n) | O(n×√n) | O(n×√n) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Code Complexity** | Medium | Simple | Simple | Simple |
| **Best For** | Single query | General case | General case | Multiple queries |
| **Mathematical Knowledge** | High | Low | Low | Low |

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `n = 12`

### Solution 1 (Mathematical):
```
Step 1: Reduce by 4
  12 % 4 = 0 → n = 12 / 4 = 3
  3 % 4 = 3 ≠ 0, stop

Step 2: Check 4 squares
  3 % 8 = 3 ≠ 7, continue

Step 3: Check 1 square
  isSquare(3)? No (1²=1, 2²=4 > 3)

Step 4: Check 2 squares
  i=1: 3 - 1 = 2, isSquare(2)? No
  i=2: 3 - 4 = -1 < 0, stop
  No 2-square representation found

Step 5: Return 3
  Result: 3
```

### Solution 2 (DP):
```
Squares: [1, 4, 9]

dp[0] = 0
dp[1] = 1 (1)
dp[2] = 2 (1+1)
dp[3] = 3 (1+1+1)
dp[4] = 1 (4)
dp[5] = 2 (4+1)
dp[6] = 3 (4+1+1)
dp[7] = 4 (4+1+1+1)
dp[8] = 2 (4+4)
dp[9] = 1 (9)
dp[10] = 2 (9+1)
dp[11] = 3 (9+1+1)
dp[12] = 3 (4+4+4)

Result: 3
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Solution | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Mathematical | O(√n) | O(1) | Fastest, requires math knowledge |
| DP | O(n×√n) | O(n) | Standard approach |
| BFS | O(n×√n) | O(n) | Graph-based approach |
| Optimized DP | O(n×√n) | O(n) | Better for multiple queries |

## Edge Cases

1. **Perfect square**: `n = 1, 4, 9, 16, ...` → return 1
2. **Sum of 2 squares**: `n = 2, 5, 10, 13, ...` → return 2
3. **Sum of 3 squares**: `n = 3, 6, 11, 12, ...` → return 3
4. **Sum of 4 squares**: `n = 7, 15, 23, ...` → return 4
5. **Large n**: `n = 10^4` → all solutions handle efficiently

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not reducing by 4**: Missing the optimization step
2. **Wrong modulo check**: Using `n % 8 == 7` incorrectly
3. **Integer overflow**: Not handling large squares correctly
4. **DP initialization**: Forgetting to set `dp[0] = 0`
5. **Square generation**: Not generating all squares up to `n`

## Key Insights

1. **Mathematical approach**: Fastest but requires number theory knowledge
2. **DP approach**: Most intuitive, similar to coin change
3. **BFS approach**: Natural for shortest path problems
4. **Optimization**: Reducing by factors of 4 doesn't change the answer
5. **Upper bound**: Maximum answer is 4 (Lagrange's theorem)

## Optimization Tips

1. **Pre-compute squares**: Generate perfect squares once
2. **Early termination**: In DP, can break early if `dp[i] == 1`
3. **Static DP**: Use static array for multiple queries
4. **Mathematical shortcuts**: Use Legendre's theorem when possible
