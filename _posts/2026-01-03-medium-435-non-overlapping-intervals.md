# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

## Problem Statement

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return *the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping*.

Note that intervals that only touch at the boundary (e.g., `[1,2]` and `[2,3]`) are considered non-overlapping.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Overlap definition**: What constitutes an overlap? (Assumption: Two intervals overlap if they share any common point - [a, b] overlaps [c, d] if max(a, c) <= min(b, d))

2. **Interval boundaries**: Are boundaries inclusive or exclusive? (Assumption: Typically inclusive on both ends [start, end] - need to clarify)

3. **Optimization goal**: What are we optimizing for? (Assumption: Minimum number of intervals to remove so remaining intervals are non-overlapping)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - minimum number of intervals to remove)

5. **Tie-breaking**: If multiple intervals overlap, which should we remove? (Assumption: Greedy approach - remove interval with later end time to maximize remaining space)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Try all possible combinations of intervals to keep. For each subset of intervals, check if they are non-overlapping, and find the subset with maximum size. The number of removals is n - max_size. This approach has exponential time complexity O(2^n), which is infeasible for n up to 10^5. The challenge is exploring all possible combinations efficiently.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming: sort intervals by start time, then dp[i] = maximum number of non-overlapping intervals we can keep ending at or before interval i. For each interval, find the last interval that doesn't overlap with it using binary search, and update dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[last_non_overlapping] + 1). This gives O(n log n) time complexity, which works but can be simplified further with a greedy approach.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use a greedy approach: sort intervals by end time. Greedily keep intervals that don't overlap with the last kept interval. The key insight is that if we want to maximize the number of intervals we keep, we should always choose the interval with the earliest end time among overlapping intervals, as it leaves the most room for future intervals. This reduces the problem to a simple greedy selection: sort by end time O(n log n), then one pass O(n) to count how many we can keep. The number of removals is n - count_kept. This achieves O(n log n) time, which is optimal for the sorting step.

## Solution Approach

This is a classic **greedy interval scheduling** problem. The key insight is to **sort intervals by end time** and greedily keep intervals that don't overlap with the last kept interval.

### Key Insights:

1. **Sort by End Time**: Sort intervals by their end time (not start time)
2. **Greedy Choice**: Keep intervals with earlier end times (maximizes remaining space)
3. **Overlap Check**: Two intervals overlap if `start < previous_end`
4. **Optimal**: This greedy strategy minimizes removals (maximizes kept intervals)

### Algorithm:

1. **Sort**: Sort intervals by end time
2. **Track**: Keep track of the end time of the last kept interval
3. **Iterate**: For each interval, if it overlaps with the last kept interval, remove it
4. **Count**: Return the number of removals

## Solution

### **Solution: Greedy with End Time Sorting**

```python
class Solution:
def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals):
    if(not intervals) return 0
    sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](u, v) :
    return u[1] < v[1]
    )
    N = len(intervals)
    right = intervals[0][1]
    removals = 0
    for(i = 1 i < N i += 1) :
    if intervals[i][0] < right:
        removals += 1
         else :
        right = intervals[i][1]
return removals

```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Edge Case (Line 4)**:
   - If intervals array is empty, return 0 (no removals needed)

2. **Sort by End Time (Lines 6-8)**:
   - Sort intervals by their end time (`u[1] < v[1]`)
   - This ensures we process intervals with earlier end times first
   - **Key**: Sorting by end time allows greedy choice to be optimal

3. **Initialize (Lines 10-11)**:
   - `right`: End time of the last kept interval
   - Initialize with first interval's end time (we always keep the first interval)
   - `removals`: Counter for number of intervals to remove

4. **Process Remaining Intervals (Lines 12-18)**:
   - **For each interval** starting from index 1:
     - **If overlaps**: `intervals[i][0] < right`
       - Current interval's start is before last kept interval's end
       - Increment `removals` (we remove this overlapping interval)
     - **Else**: No overlap
       - Update `right` to current interval's end time
       - Keep this interval (don't increment removals)

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**Example 1: `intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]`**

**After sorting by end time:**
```
Original: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Sorted:   [[1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [3,4]]
          [1,2] end=2
          [2,3] end=3
          [1,3] end=3
          [3,4] end=4
```

**Execution:**
```
Initial: right = 2 (from [1,2]), removals = 0

i=1: [2,3]
  Check: 2 < 2? No (no overlap)
  Keep: right = 3, removals = 0

i=2: [1,3]
  Check: 1 < 3? Yes (overlaps with [2,3])
  Remove: removals = 1

i=3: [3,4]
  Check: 3 < 3? No (no overlap, boundary touch is OK)
  Keep: right = 4, removals = 1

Result: 1 removal
Kept intervals: [1,2], [2,3], [3,4]
```

**Example 2: `intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]`**

**After sorting by end time:**
```
All intervals have same end time: [[1,2], [1,2], [1,2]]
```

**Execution:**
```
Initial: right = 2 (from first [1,2]), removals = 0

i=1: [1,2]
  Check: 1 < 2? Yes (overlaps)
  Remove: removals = 1

i=2: [1,2]
  Check: 1 < 2? Yes (overlaps)
  Remove: removals = 2

Result: 2 removals
Kept intervals: [1,2] (only the first one)
```

**Example 3: `intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]`**

**After sorting by end time:**
```
Already sorted: [[1,2], [2,3]]
```

**Execution:**
```
Initial: right = 2 (from [1,2]), removals = 0

i=1: [2,3]
  Check: 2 < 2? No (no overlap, boundary touch is OK)
  Keep: right = 3, removals = 0

Result: 0 removals
Kept intervals: [1,2], [2,3]
```

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Why Sort by End Time?**

Sorting by end time is crucial for the greedy strategy:

1. **Maximize Remaining Space**: Intervals with earlier end times leave more room for future intervals
2. **Optimal Choice**: Keeping the interval with earliest end time is always optimal
3. **Greedy Property**: This choice doesn't prevent optimal solutions later

**Counter-example (sorting by start time):**
```
Intervals: [[1,10], [2,3], [4,5]]

Sort by start: [[1,10], [2,3], [4,5]]
  Keep [1,10] → right = 10
  [2,3] overlaps (2 < 10) → remove
  [4,5] overlaps (4 < 10) → remove
  Removals: 2

Sort by end: [[2,3], [4,5], [1,10]]
  Keep [2,3] → right = 3
  [4,5] no overlap (4 >= 3) → keep, right = 5
  [1,10] overlaps (1 < 5) → remove
  Removals: 1 (optimal!)
```

### **Overlap Detection**

Two intervals `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` overlap if:
```
c < b  (current start < previous end)
```

**Why not `c <= b`?**
- The problem states: "intervals that only touch at the boundary are considered non-overlapping"
- So `[1,2]` and `[2,3]` are **not** overlapping
- We use `<` instead of `<=`

### **Greedy Strategy**

The algorithm uses a greedy strategy:
1. **Always keep the first interval** (after sorting)
2. **For each subsequent interval**:
   - If it doesn't overlap with the last kept interval → keep it
   - If it overlaps → remove it (we already have a better choice)

This maximizes the number of kept intervals, which minimizes removals.

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - **Sorting**: O(n log n) where n is the number of intervals
  - **Iteration**: O(n) - single pass through sorted intervals
  - **Total**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using a few variables
  - Sorting is in-place (or O(n) if not in-place, but typically O(1) extra space)

## Key Points

1. **Sort by End Time**: Critical for greedy strategy to work
2. **Greedy Choice**: Keep intervals with earliest end times
3. **Overlap Check**: Use `<` not `<=` (boundary touch is non-overlapping)
4. **Optimal**: Greedy approach finds optimal solution
5. **Simple**: Straightforward implementation after sorting

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: Greedy with End Time Sorting (Current Solution)**
- **Time**: O(n log n)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Best for**: Optimal solution, most efficient

### **Approach 2: Dynamic Programming**
- **Time**: O(n²)
- **Space**: O(n)
- **Use when**: Need to track which intervals to keep
- **Idea**: `dp[i]` = max intervals we can keep ending at interval i

### **Approach 3: Sort by Start Time (Incorrect)**
- **Time**: O(n log n)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Problem**: Doesn't guarantee optimal solution
- **Example**: Fails on `[[1,10], [2,3], [4,5]]`

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty array**: `[]` → return 0
2. **Single interval**: `[[1,2]]` → return 0
3. **No overlaps**: `[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]` → return 0
4. **All overlap**: `[[1,3],[1,3],[1,3]]` → return 2
5. **Boundary touch**: `[[1,2],[2,3]]` → return 0 (non-overlapping)
6. **Nested intervals**: `[[1,5],[2,3],[4,6]]` → return 1

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong sort key**: Sorting by start time instead of end time
2. **Wrong overlap condition**: Using `<=` instead of `<`
3. **Not handling empty input**: Forgetting edge case
4. **Wrong initialization**: Not initializing `right` correctly
5. **Off-by-one error**: Starting loop from wrong index
