# 285. Inorder Successor in BST

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and a node `p` in it, return *the in-order successor of that node in the BST*. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the node 6, so the answer is null.
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- All Nodes will have unique values.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **In-order successor definition**: What is an in-order successor? (Assumption: Node with smallest value greater than given node's value - next node in in-order traversal)

2. **BST properties**: What are BST properties? (Assumption: Left subtree < root < right subtree - can use this to navigate)

3. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Pointer to successor node, or nullptr if no successor exists)

4. **Node reference**: How is target node given? (Assumption: Given node pointer p - need to find its successor)

5. **Rightmost node**: What if node is rightmost? (Assumption: Return nullptr - no successor exists)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Perform an in-order traversal of the BST, collect all nodes in a list, find the given node in the list, and return the next node. This approach works but requires O(n) time and O(n) space for the traversal, which is inefficient.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use in-order traversal with early termination: traverse the BST in-order, track the previous node. When we encounter the target node, return the next node we visit. However, we still need to traverse potentially the entire tree, and handling the case where the target is the rightmost node requires special care.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use BST properties: if the target node has a right child, the successor is the leftmost node in its right subtree. If the target node doesn't have a right child, the successor is the lowest ancestor whose left subtree contains the target node. Traverse from root to target, keeping track of the last node where we went left (this is the potential successor). This achieves O(h) time where h is the height of the tree, which is O(log n) for balanced BSTs. The key insight is leveraging BST properties: the successor is either in the right subtree (if it exists) or is an ancestor where we took a left turn.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires finding the in-order successor of a given node in a BST. The in-order successor is the node with the smallest value greater than the given node's value.

### Key Insights:

1. **Two Cases**: 
   - **Case 1**: Node `p` has a right child → successor is the leftmost node in right subtree
   - **Case 2**: Node `p` has no right child → successor is an ancestor (lowest ancestor with left child being ancestor of p)

2. **BST Property**: Use BST property to traverse efficiently
3. **Iterative Search**: Search from root to find the successor when p has no right child

### Algorithm:

1. **Check right child**: If `p->right` exists, find leftmost node in right subtree
2. **Search from root**: If no right child, traverse from root to find successor
3. **Track candidate**: Keep track of node with value greater than `p->val`

## Solution

### **Solution: Two-Case Handling**

```python
/
 Definition for a binary tree node.
 struct TreeNode :
     val
     TreeNode left
     TreeNode right
     TreeNode(x) : val(x), left(None), right(None) :
/
class Solution:
def inorderSuccessor(self, root, p):
    TreeNode successor = None
    if p.right != None:
        successor = p.right
        while successor.left != None:
            successor = successor.left
        return successor
    TreeNode node = root
    while node != None:
        if node.val > p.val:
            successor = node
            node = node.left
             else :
            node = node.right
    return successor

```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Case 1: Node has Right Child (Lines 12-19)**:
   - If `p->right` exists, the successor is in the right subtree
   - Go to right child: `successor = p->right`
   - Find leftmost node: Traverse left until `nullptr`
   - Return the leftmost node (smallest value in right subtree)

2. **Case 2: Node has No Right Child (Lines 20-29)**:
   - If `p->right` is `nullptr`, successor is an ancestor
   - Traverse from root to find successor
   - **When `node->val > p->val`**:
     - Current node is a candidate (greater than p)
     - Update `successor = node`
     - Go left to find smaller candidate (if exists)
   - **When `node->val <= p->val`**:
     - Current node is not greater than p
     - Go right to find larger node
   - Return `successor` (lowest ancestor with value > p->val)

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**Example 1: `root = [2,1,3], p = 1`**

```
BST:
    2
   / \
  1   3

Case 2: p (1) has no right child
Traverse from root:

Step 1: node = 2, p->val = 1
  node->val (2) > p->val (1) → candidate found!
  successor = 2
  Go left: node = 1

Step 2: node = 1, p->val = 1
  node->val (1) <= p->val (1) → not a candidate
  Go right: node = nullptr

Result: successor = 2
```

**Example 2: `root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 3`**

```
BST:
        5
       / \
      3   6
     / \
    2   4
   /
  1

Case 1: p (3) has right child (4)
  successor = p->right = 4
  Check left: 4->left = nullptr
  Return: 4
```

**Example 3: `root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6`**

```
BST:
        5
       / \
      3   6
     / \
    2   4
   /
  1

Case 2: p (6) has no right child
Traverse from root:

Step 1: node = 5, p->val = 6
  node->val (5) <= p->val (6) → not a candidate
  Go right: node = 6

Step 2: node = 6, p->val = 6
  node->val (6) <= p->val (6) → not a candidate
  Go right: node = nullptr

Result: successor = nullptr (no successor)
```

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Key Insight: Two Distinct Cases**

The in-order successor can be found in two different locations:

**Case 1: Right Subtree Exists**
- If `p` has a right child, the successor is **always** in the right subtree
- Specifically, it's the **leftmost node** in the right subtree
- This is the smallest value greater than `p->val`

**Case 2: No Right Subtree**
- If `p` has no right child, the successor is an **ancestor**
- It's the **lowest ancestor** whose left subtree contains `p`
- We find it by traversing from root and tracking candidates

### **BST Property Utilization**

When searching from root (Case 2):
```python
if node.val > p.val:
    successor = node      # Candidate found
    node = node.left     # Try to find smaller candidate
     else :
    node = node.right    # Need larger value

```

- **Go left**: When current node is greater, try to find smaller candidate
- **Go right**: When current node is not greater, need to find larger value
- **Track candidate**: Keep the smallest node with value > p->val

### **Why This Works**

1. **Case 1 (Right child exists)**:
   - In-order traversal: left → root → right
   - After visiting `p`, we visit its right subtree
   - The first node in right subtree (leftmost) is the successor

2. **Case 2 (No right child)**:
   - After visiting `p`, we backtrack to ancestors
   - The successor is the first ancestor we haven't visited yet
   - This is the lowest ancestor whose left subtree contains `p`

## Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity:** O(h)
- **Case 1**: O(h) - Find leftmost node in right subtree (at most h steps)
- **Case 2**: O(h) - Traverse from root to find successor (at most h steps)
- **Total**: O(h) where h = height of tree
  - **Balanced BST**: O(log n)
  - **Unbalanced BST**: O(n)

### **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Variables**: Only `successor` and `node` pointers
- **No recursion**: Iterative approach
- **No extra data structures**: Constant space
- **Total**: O(1)

## Key Points

1. **Two Cases**: Handle right child and no right child separately
2. **BST Property**: Use BST property to traverse efficiently
3. **Leftmost Node**: In right subtree, find leftmost node
4. **Ancestor Search**: When no right child, search from root
5. **Space Efficient**: O(1) space, no recursion stack

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: Two-Case Handling (Current Solution)**
- **Time**: O(h)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Best for**: Space-efficient solution

### **Approach 2: In-Order Traversal**
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(h) for recursion
- **Traverse**: Do in-order traversal, find p, return next
- **Use case**: When you need to understand in-order sequence

### **Approach 3: Recursive Search**
- **Time**: O(h)
- **Space**: O(h) for recursion stack
- **Recursive**: Recursively search for successor
- **Similar logic**: But uses recursion instead of iteration

## Detailed Example Walkthrough

### **Example: `root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 2`**

```
BST:
        5
       / \
      3   6
     / \
    2   4
   /
  1

Case 2: p (2) has no right child
Traverse from root to find successor:

Step 1: node = 5, p->val = 2
  node->val (5) > p->val (2) → candidate!
  successor = 5
  Go left: node = 3

Step 2: node = 3, p->val = 2
  node->val (3) > p->val (2) → candidate!
  successor = 3 (better candidate, smaller than 5)
  Go left: node = 2

Step 3: node = 2, p->val = 2
  node->val (2) <= p->val (2) → not a candidate
  Go right: node = nullptr

Result: successor = 3
```

### **Visual Explanation:**

```
In-order traversal: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6

For p = 2:
- In-order: ... → 2 → 3 → ...
- Successor: 3

For p = 3:
- In-order: ... → 3 → 4 → ...
- Successor: 4 (leftmost in right subtree)

For p = 6:
- In-order: ... → 6 → (end)
- Successor: null (no node after 6)
```

## Edge Cases

1. **Largest node**: No successor (return `null`)
2. **Node with right child**: Successor in right subtree
3. **Node without right child**: Successor is ancestor
4. **Single node tree**: If p is the only node, return `null`
5. **Root node**: Successor depends on whether it has right child
