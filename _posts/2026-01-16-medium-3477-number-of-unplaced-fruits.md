# 3477. Number of Unplaced Fruits

## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `fruits` and `baskets`.

- `fruits[i]` represents the quantity of the `i`-th type of fruit.
- `baskets[j]` represents the capacity of the `j`-th basket.

You process fruits from left to right. For each fruit type, you must place it in the **leftmost** available basket whose capacity is **greater than or equal to** the fruit's quantity.

- Each basket can hold **at most one** type of fruit.
- If no such basket exists for a fruit type, it remains **unplaced**.

Return *the number of fruit types that are **not placed** after trying to place all fruits*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: fruits = [4, 2, 5], baskets = [3, 5, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- Fruit 4: Place in leftmost basket with capacity >= 4 → baskets[1] = 5 (placed)
- Fruit 2: Place in leftmost basket with capacity >= 2 → baskets[0] = 3 (placed)
- Fruit 5: Requires capacity >= 5, but remaining basket baskets[2] = 4 < 5 → unplaced
Result: 1 unplaced fruit
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: fruits = [3, 2, 1], baskets = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 0
Explanation:
- Fruit 3: Place in baskets[2] = 3 (placed)
- Fruit 2: Place in baskets[1] = 2 (placed)
- Fruit 1: Place in baskets[0] = 1 (placed)
Result: 0 unplaced fruits
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= baskets.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= fruits[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= baskets[j] <= 10^9`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Placement rule**: What is the rule for placing fruits in baskets? (Assumption: Place each fruit in the leftmost basket with capacity >= fruit size)

2. **One fruit per basket**: Can a basket hold multiple fruits or just one? (Assumption: One fruit per basket - each basket can hold at most one fruit)

3. **Basket capacity**: What does basket capacity represent? (Assumption: Maximum size of fruit that can be placed in that basket)

4. **Fruit order**: Are fruits processed in the given order? (Assumption: Yes - process fruits sequentially in the given order)

5. **Return value**: What should we return - count of unplaced fruits or list of unplaced fruits? (Assumption: Return count of unplaced fruits - integer)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Start with a straightforward solution: for each fruit, scan all baskets from left to right to find the first available basket with capacity >= fruit quantity. Use a boolean array to track which baskets are already used. This approach is simple but has O(n × m) time complexity, which is too slow for large inputs (up to 10^5).

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Optimize the basket search using a sorted data structure. Sort baskets by capacity and use a balanced BST or multiset to maintain unused baskets. However, maintaining the "leftmost" property becomes tricky since we need to preserve original index order, not just capacity order. This approach improves query time but still requires careful handling of the leftmost constraint.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use a Segment Tree to efficiently find the leftmost index with capacity >= fruit quantity. Build a segment tree storing maximum capacity in each range. For each fruit, query the tree to find the leftmost basket that can hold it, then update the tree to mark that basket as used (set capacity to 0). This achieves O(n log m) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem. The segment tree naturally handles the leftmost property by checking the left child first during queries.

## Solution Approach

This is a **greedy matching** problem where we need to find the leftmost available basket for each fruit. The challenge is to do this efficiently for large inputs.

### Key Insights:

1. **Greedy Strategy**: Always use the leftmost available basket that can hold the fruit
2. **Leftmost Requirement**: Must maintain original index order (not just any basket)
3. **Capacity Constraint**: Basket capacity must be >= fruit quantity
4. **One-to-One Matching**: Each basket can only hold one fruit
5. **Efficient Query**: Need to find leftmost index with capacity >= value quickly

### Algorithm:

1. **Segment Tree**: Build segment tree storing maximum capacity in each range
2. **Query**: Find leftmost index with capacity >= fruit quantity
3. **Update**: Mark basket as used (set capacity to 0) after placing fruit
4. **Count Unplaced**: Track fruits that can't find a suitable basket

## Solution

### **Solution: Segment Tree for Leftmost Query**

```python
struct SegmentTree :
n
list[int> tree
SegmentTree(list[int> baskets) :
n = len(baskets)
tree.resize(4n)
build(1, 0, n-1, baskets)
def build(self, node, l, r, baskets):
    if l == r:
        tree[node] = baskets[l]
         else :
        mid = (l + r) / 2
        build(node2, l, mid, baskets)
        build(node2+1, mid+1, r, baskets)
        tree[node] = max(tree[node2], tree[node2+1])
// Find leftmost index >= l with value >= val
def query(self, node, l, r, val):
    if (tree[node] < val) return -1 // no basket in this range can hold fruit
    if (l == r) return l // found
    mid = (l + r) / 2
    left = query(node2, l, mid, val)
    if (left != -1) return left
    return query(node2+1, mid+1, r, val)
def update(self, node, l, r, idx):
    if l == r:
        tree[node] = 0 // mark basket used
         else :
        mid = (l + r) / 2
        if idx <= mid) update(node*2, l, mid, idx:
        else update(node2+1, mid+1, r, idx)
        tree[node] = max(tree[node2], tree[node2+1])
class Solution:
def numOfUnplacedFruits(self, fruits, baskets):
    n = len(baskets)
    SegmentTree st(baskets)
    unplaced = 0
    for f in fruits:
        idx = st.query(1, 0, n-1, f)
        if idx == -1:
            unplaced += 1
             else :
            st.update(1, 0, n-1, idx) // mark basket used
    return unplaced
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

#### **SegmentTree Class:**

1. **Constructor (Lines 5-9)**:
   - Initialize segment tree with size `4 * n`
   - Build tree from baskets array

2. **build() (Lines 11-20)**:
   - Recursively build segment tree
   - Each node stores maximum capacity in its range
   - Leaf nodes store individual basket capacities

3. **query() (Lines 22-30)**:
   - Find leftmost index with capacity >= `val`
   - **Early Termination**: If `tree[node] < val`, no basket in range can hold fruit → return -1
   - **Left-First Search**: Check left child first to maintain leftmost property
   - **Base Case**: If leaf node and capacity >= val, return index

4. **update() (Lines 32-42)**:
   - Mark basket as used by setting capacity to 0
   - Update parent nodes to reflect new maximum

#### **Solution Class:**

1. **Main Function (Lines 45-58)**:
   - Build segment tree from baskets
   - For each fruit:
     - Query for leftmost basket with capacity >= fruit quantity
     - If found, update basket (mark as used)
     - If not found, increment unplaced count
   - Return number of unplaced fruits

### **How It Works:**

- **Segment Tree Structure**: Each node stores maximum capacity in its range
- **Leftmost Query**: By checking left child first, we ensure leftmost index is found
- **Efficient Updates**: After placing fruit, basket capacity becomes 0 (unavailable)
- **Greedy Matching**: Always uses leftmost available basket that fits

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**Input:** `fruits = [4, 2, 5], baskets = [3, 5, 4]`

```
Initial Segment Tree:
        [5] (max of [3,5,4])
       /   \
    [5]     [4]
   /   \   /   \
  [3] [5] [4] [0]
   0   1   2   3

Step 1: Process fruit = 4
  query(1, 0, 2, 4):
    - Check left [0,1]: max = 5 >= 4 → explore left
    - Check left [0,0]: max = 3 < 4 → skip
    - Check right [1,1]: max = 5 >= 4 → found at index 1
  Place fruit 4 in basket[1]
  Update: basket[1] = 0
  Tree: [4] (max of [3,0,4])
  
Step 2: Process fruit = 2
  query(1, 0, 2, 2):
    - Check left [0,1]: max = 3 >= 2 → explore left
    - Check left [0,0]: max = 3 >= 2 → found at index 0
  Place fruit 2 in basket[0]
  Update: basket[0] = 0
  Tree: [4] (max of [0,0,4])
  
Step 3: Process fruit = 5
  query(1, 0, 2, 5):
    - Check left [0,1]: max = 0 < 5 → skip
    - Check right [2,2]: max = 4 < 5 → no solution
  No basket found → unplaced++
  
Result: 1 unplaced fruit
```

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log m)
  - Building segment tree: O(m)
  - For each fruit: O(log m) for query + O(log m) for update
  - Overall: O(m + n log m) ≈ O(n log m) where n = fruits.length, m = baskets.length

- **Space Complexity:** O(m)
  - Segment tree: O(4m) = O(m)
  - Other variables: O(1)
  - Overall: O(m)

## Key Insights

1. **Segment Tree for Range Max**: Efficiently find leftmost index with capacity >= value
2. **Left-First Traversal**: Check left child first to maintain leftmost property
3. **Greedy Matching**: Always use leftmost available basket
4. **Update Strategy**: Mark basket as used by setting capacity to 0
5. **Early Termination**: If max capacity in range < required, skip entire range

## Edge Cases

1. **All fruits placed**: `fruits = [1, 2], baskets = [2, 3]` → return `0`
2. **No fruits placed**: `fruits = [5, 6], baskets = [1, 2]` → return `2`
3. **Exact match**: `fruits = [3], baskets = [3]` → return `0`
4. **Single basket**: `fruits = [1, 2], baskets = [2]` → return `1`
5. **Large capacities**: Handle up to 10^9 values

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not maintaining leftmost order**: Using any basket instead of leftmost
2. **Wrong query logic**: Not checking left child first
3. **Incorrect update**: Not properly updating parent nodes after marking basket used
4. **Off-by-one errors**: Incorrect index calculations in segment tree
5. **Not handling duplicates**: Same basket capacity appearing multiple times

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 2: Greedy with Boolean Array (Brute Force)**

Simple approach for small inputs:

```python
class Solution:
def numOfUnplacedFruits(self, fruits, baskets):
    n = len(baskets)
    list[bool> used(n, False)
    unplaced = 0
    for f in fruits:
        bool placed = False
        for (j = 0 j < n j += 1) :
        if not used[j]  and  baskets[j] >= f:
            used[j] = True
            placed = True
            break
    if (not placed) unplaced += 1
return unplaced
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n × m) - Too slow for large inputs  
**Space Complexity:** O(m)

**When to Use:**
- Small inputs (n, m ≤ 1000)
- Simple implementation preferred
- Not suitable for constraints up to 10^5

### **Approach 3: Multiset/Balanced BST (Alternative)**

Use ordered set to maintain unused baskets, but maintaining leftmost property is tricky.

**Comparison:**

| Approach | Time | Space | Complexity | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|------------|-------|
| **Brute Force** | O(n × m) | O(m) | Low | Simple, only for small inputs |
| **Segment Tree** | O(n log m) | O(m) | Medium | Efficient, handles large inputs |
| **Multiset** | O(n log m) | O(m) | Medium | Harder to maintain leftmost property |
