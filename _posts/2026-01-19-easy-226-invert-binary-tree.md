# [Easy] 226. Invert Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return *its root*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

Before inversion:
      4
     / \
    2   7
   / \ / \
  1  3 6  9

After inversion:
      4
     / \
    7   2
   / \ / \
  9  6 3  1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]

Before inversion:
    2
   / \
  1   3

After inversion:
    2
   / \
  3   1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Inversion definition**: What exactly does "invert" mean? (Assumption: Swap left and right children for every node in the tree)

2. **Tree modification**: Should we modify the tree in-place or return a new tree? (Assumption: Modify in-place - return the root of the modified tree)

3. **Empty tree**: What should we return for an empty tree? (Assumption: Return null - no tree to invert)

4. **Single node**: What happens with a tree containing only root? (Assumption: Return root unchanged - no children to swap)

5. **Recursive vs iterative**: Are there any constraints on using recursion? (Assumption: No - recursion is fine, but iterative approach also works)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)**

Create a new tree with the same structure but swapped children. Traverse the original tree, and for each node, create a new node with left and right children swapped. This approach works but requires O(n) extra space for the new tree and O(n) time to build it. Since we're modifying in-place, this isn't necessary.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)**

Use iterative BFS with a queue. Process nodes level by level, swapping left and right children for each node, then enqueue both children. This approach uses O(w) space where w is the maximum width of the tree, and O(n) time. It works well but requires maintaining a queue data structure.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)**

Use recursive DFS: for each node, recursively invert the left and right subtrees, then swap the left and right children of the current node. Base case: if node is null, return null. This approach uses O(h) space for the recursion stack where h is the height, and O(n) time to visit all nodes. The recursive solution is elegant, naturally handles the tree structure, and modifies the tree in-place without extra data structures beyond the call stack.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires swapping the left and right children of every node in the tree. We can use a recursive DFS approach to traverse the tree and swap children at each node.

### Key Insights:

1. **Swap Children**: For each node, swap its left and right children
2. **Recursive Traversal**: Process subtrees recursively
3. **Base Case**: Empty node (null) requires no action
4. **In-Place Modification**: Modify the tree structure directly

## Solution: Recursive DFS

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right


class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root):
        if not root:
            return root

        tmp = root.left
        root.left = self.invertTree(root.right)
        root.right = self.invertTree(tmp)

        return root
```

### Algorithm Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: 
   - If `root` is `nullptr`, return `root` (no action needed)

2. **Swap Children**:
   - Store `root->left` in a temporary variable `tmp`
   - Recursively invert `root->right` and assign to `root->left`
   - Recursively invert the original `root->left` (stored in `tmp`) and assign to `root->right`

3. **Return**: Return the modified root node

### Why This Works?

The algorithm uses **post-order traversal** (process children before parent):
- First, recursively invert both subtrees
- Then swap the already-inverted subtrees
- This ensures all nodes below are inverted before swapping

**Alternative interpretation**: The algorithm swaps children and then recursively inverts the swapped subtrees, which is equivalent to inverting subtrees first then swapping.

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]`

```
Initial tree:
      4
     / \
    2   7
   / \ / \
  1  3 6  9

invertTree(4):
  root = 4, has children
  tmp = 2 (left child)
  
  root->left = invertTree(7):
    root = 7, has children
    tmp = 6 (left child)
    
    root->left = invertTree(9):
      root = 9, leaf node
      return 9
    
    root->right = invertTree(6):
      root = 6, leaf node
      return 6
    
    After swap: 7 has children (9, 6)
    return 7
  
  root->right = invertTree(2):
    root = 2, has children
    tmp = 1 (left child)
    
    root->left = invertTree(3):
      root = 3, leaf node
      return 3
    
    root->right = invertTree(1):
      root = 1, leaf node
      return 1
    
    After swap: 2 has children (3, 1)
    return 2
  
  After swap: 4 has children (7, 2)
  return 4

Final tree:
      4
     / \
    7   2
   / \ / \
  9  6 3  1
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Visit each node exactly once
  - n = number of nodes in tree

- **Space Complexity:** O(h)
  - Recursion call stack depth = height of tree
  - Best case (balanced): O(log n)
  - Worst case (skewed): O(n)

## Alternative Approaches

### Solution 2: Simplified Recursive DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root):
        if not root:
            return None

        left = self.invertTree(root.left)
        right = self.invertTree(root.right)

        root.left = right
        root.right = left

        return root
```

**Key Difference**: More explicit - invert subtrees first, then swap

**Complexity**: Same as Solution 1

### Solution 3: Iterative DFS with Stack

```python
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root):
        if not root:
            return None

        st = [root]

        while st:
            node = st.pop()

            # Swap children
            tmp = node.left
            node.left = node.right
            node.right = tmp

            # Push children to stack
            if node.left:
                st.append(node.left)

            if node.right:
                st.append(node.right)

        return root
```

**Complexity**: 
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(h) for stack

### Solution 4: Iterative BFS with Queue

```python
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root):
        if not root:
            return None

        q = [root]

        while q:
            node = q.pop(0)

            # Swap children
            tmp = node.left
            node.left = node.right
            node.right = tmp

            # Enqueue children
            if node.left:
                q.append(node.left)

            if node.right:
                q.append(node.right)

        return root
```

**Complexity**: 
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(w) where w is maximum width

## Key Insights

1. **Post-order Traversal**: Process children before parent (or swap then recurse)
2. **In-Place Modification**: Modify tree structure directly, no need for new tree
3. **Symmetric Operation**: Swapping is symmetric - order doesn't matter
4. **Base Case**: Empty node requires no action
5. **Return Root**: Always return the root node after modification

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty tree**: `root = null` → return `null`
2. **Single node**: `root = [1]` → return `[1]` (no change)
3. **Skewed tree**: `[1,2,null]` → becomes `[1,null,2]`
4. **Balanced tree**: Works correctly for any balanced tree
5. **Large tree**: Handles up to 100 nodes efficiently

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not handling null**: Forgetting to check for empty node
   ```cpp
   // WRONG:
   TreeNode* tmp = root->left; // ❌ Crashes if root is null
   ```

2. **Wrong traversal order**: Processing parent before children (pre-order)
3. **Creating new nodes**: Unnecessarily creating new tree instead of modifying in-place
4. **Not returning root**: Forgetting to return the modified root
5. **Swapping before recursion**: Should swap after or during recursion

## Comparison of Approaches

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Recursive DFS (Provided)** | O(n) | O(h) | Clean, concise | Recursion overhead |
| **Simplified Recursive DFS** | O(n) | O(h) | More explicit | Same as above |
| **Iterative DFS** | O(n) | O(h) | No recursion overhead | More code |
| **Iterative BFS** | O(n) | O(w) | Level-order traversal | More space for wide trees |

## When to Use Each Approach

- **Recursive DFS**: Most common, simplest solution (recommended)
- **Iterative DFS**: When avoiding recursion or stack overflow concerns
- **Iterative BFS**: When level-order processing is preferred
