# 1217. Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position

## Problem Statement

We have `n` chips, where the position of the `i`-th chip is `position[i]`.

We need to move all the chips to **the same position**. In one step, we can change the position of the `i`-th chip from `position[i]` to:

- `position[i] + 2` or `position[i] - 2` with cost = **0**.
- `position[i] + 1` or `position[i] - 1` with cost = **1**.

Return *the minimum cost* needed to move all the chips to the same position.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: position = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1 with cost = 0.
Second step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.
Total cost is 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: position = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can move the two chips at position 3 to position 2. Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: position = [1,1000000000]
Output: 1
Explanation: Move chip at position 1000000000 to position 1 with cost = 1.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= position.length <= 100`
- `1 <= position[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Chip movement**: How do chips move? (Assumption: Move chip 2 positions costs 0, move chip 1 position costs 1 - parity-based movement)

2. **Goal**: What are we trying to achieve? (Assumption: Move all chips to same position with minimum cost)

3. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - minimum cost to move all chips to same position)

4. **Position range**: What is the range of positions? (Assumption: Per constraints, 1 <= position[i] <= 10^9 - very large range)

5. **Cost calculation**: How is cost calculated? (Assumption: Moving even distance (2, 4, 6...) costs 0, moving odd distance (1, 3, 5...) costs 1)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)**

Try moving all chips to each possible position, calculate the cost for each target position, and return the minimum. For each target position, sum the costs: cost 0 for chips already at that position, cost 1 for chips at positions with same parity (even/odd), cost 1 for chips at positions with different parity (but need to move via intermediate position). This approach works but requires checking all positions, giving O(n × m) complexity where n is number of positions and m is number of chips.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)**

Recognize that moving chips between positions with same parity (both even or both odd) costs 0 (can move 2 positions at a time for free). Moving chips between different parities costs 1. So we only need to consider two target positions: all even positions or all odd positions. Count chips at even positions and odd positions, then choose the target with fewer chips (move those to the other parity).

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)**

Count chips at even-indexed positions and odd-indexed positions. Since moving within same parity is free, we can consolidate all chips to one parity for free. Then we only need to move chips from the less populated parity to the more populated one, which costs 1 per chip. The answer is min(count_even, count_odd). This achieves O(n) time where n is number of chips, which is optimal. The key insight is that parity (even/odd) is the only factor that matters - chips at positions with same parity can be consolidated for free, and we only pay to move chips between parities.

## Solution Approach

This is a **greedy algorithm** problem with a key mathematical insight. The crucial observation is that moving chips by 2 positions costs 0, while moving by 1 position costs 1.

### Key Insights:

1. **Parity Matters**: Chips at even positions can be moved to any even position for free (cost 0)
2. **Parity Matters**: Chips at odd positions can be moved to any odd position for free (cost 0)
3. **Cross-Parity Cost**: Moving from even to odd (or vice versa) costs 1 per chip
4. **Optimal Strategy**: 
   - Move all chips to either all even positions or all odd positions (cost 0)
   - Then move all chips from one parity to the other (cost 1 per chip)
   - Choose the parity with fewer chips to minimize cost

### Algorithm:

1. **Count Chips by Parity**: Count chips at even positions and odd positions
2. **Choose Minimum**: Return the minimum of the two counts
   - This represents moving all chips from the minority parity to the majority parity

## Solution

### **Solution: Greedy with Parity Counting**

```python
class Solution:
def minCostToMoveChips(self, position):
    even = 0, odd = 0
    for pos in position:
        if pos % 2 == 0:
            odd += 1
             else :
            even += 1
    return min(odd, even)
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Counters (Line 4)**:
   - `even`: Count of chips at odd positions (note: variable name is swapped)
   - `odd`: Count of chips at even positions (note: variable name is swapped)
   - **Note**: The variable names are swapped in the code, but the logic is correct

2. **Count Chips by Parity (Lines 5-10)**:
   - **For each chip position**:
     - **If position is even** (`pos % 2 == 0`):
       - Increment `odd` (counts even positions)
     - **If position is odd** (`pos % 2 != 0`):
       - Increment `even` (counts odd positions)

3. **Return Minimum (Line 11)**:
   - Return `min(odd, even)`
   - This is `min(count of even positions, count of odd positions)`
   - Represents the cost to move all chips from the minority parity to the majority parity

### **Why This Works:**

**Key Insight**: Moving by 2 positions costs 0, moving by 1 position costs 1.

**Strategy**:
1. **Step 1**: Move all chips to the same parity (even or odd) - **cost 0**
   - Chips at even positions → move to any even position (cost 0)
   - Chips at odd positions → move to any odd position (cost 0)
2. **Step 2**: Move all chips from one parity to the other - **cost 1 per chip**
   - If we have fewer chips at even positions, move them to odd positions
   - If we have fewer chips at odd positions, move them to even positions
   - Cost = number of chips in the minority parity

**Example Walkthrough:**

**Example 1: `position = [1,2,3]`**

**Count by parity:**
```
Position 1 (odd): 1 chip
Position 2 (even): 1 chip
Position 3 (odd): 1 chip

Even positions: 1 chip (at position 2)
Odd positions: 2 chips (at positions 1, 3)
```

**Execution:**
```
Step 1: Move all chips to same parity (cost 0)
  - Chip at position 1 (odd) → move to position 3 (odd): cost 0
  - Chip at position 2 (even) → move to position 2 (even): cost 0
  - Chip at position 3 (odd) → already at odd position: cost 0
  Result: 2 chips at odd positions, 1 chip at even position

Step 2: Move minority parity to majority (cost 1)
  - Move chip at even position (position 2) to odd position (position 1 or 3): cost 1
  Result: All chips at odd positions

Total cost: 0 + 1 = 1
```

**Code execution:**
```
Initial: even = 0, odd = 0

pos = 1: pos % 2 = 1 (odd) → even++ → even = 1
pos = 2: pos % 2 = 0 (even) → odd++ → odd = 1
pos = 3: pos % 2 = 1 (odd) → even++ → even = 2

even = 2 (counts odd positions)
odd = 1 (counts even positions)

min(odd, even) = min(1, 2) = 1
```

**Example 2: `position = [2,2,2,3,3]`**

**Count by parity:**
```
Position 2 (even): 3 chips
Position 3 (odd): 2 chips

Even positions: 3 chips
Odd positions: 2 chips
```

**Execution:**
```
Step 1: Move all chips to same parity (cost 0)
  - All chips at even positions → already at even: cost 0
  - All chips at odd positions → already at odd: cost 0

Step 2: Move minority parity to majority (cost 2)
  - Move 2 chips from odd positions to even positions: cost 2 (1 per chip)
  Result: All chips at even positions

Total cost: 0 + 2 = 2
```

**Code execution:**
```
Initial: even = 0, odd = 0

pos = 2: pos % 2 = 0 (even) → odd++ → odd = 1
pos = 2: pos % 2 = 0 (even) → odd++ → odd = 2
pos = 2: pos % 2 = 0 (even) → odd++ → odd = 3
pos = 3: pos % 2 = 1 (odd) → even++ → even = 1
pos = 3: pos % 2 = 1 (odd) → even++ → even = 2

even = 2 (counts odd positions)
odd = 3 (counts even positions)

min(odd, even) = min(3, 2) = 2
```

**Example 3: `position = [1,1000000000]`**

**Count by parity:**
```
Position 1 (odd): 1 chip
Position 1000000000 (even): 1 chip

Even positions: 1 chip
Odd positions: 1 chip
```

**Execution:**
```
Step 1: Move all chips to same parity (cost 0)
  - Chip at position 1 (odd) → already at odd: cost 0
  - Chip at position 1000000000 (even) → move to position 2 (even): cost 0
    (Move by 2 positions: 1000000000 - 2 = 999999998, then continue...)

Step 2: Move one chip from even to odd (cost 1)
  - Move chip at even position to odd position: cost 1

Total cost: 0 + 1 = 1
```

**Code execution:**
```
Initial: even = 0, odd = 0

pos = 1: pos % 2 = 1 (odd) → even++ → even = 1
pos = 1000000000: pos % 2 = 0 (even) → odd++ → odd = 1

even = 1 (counts odd positions)
odd = 1 (counts even positions)

min(odd, even) = min(1, 1) = 1
```

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Why Parity Matters**

**Moving by 2 positions (cost 0):**
- Position `i` → Position `i+2` or `i-2`: **cost 0**
- This preserves parity (even stays even, odd stays odd)
- Can move any distance in steps of 2 for free

**Moving by 1 position (cost 1):**
- Position `i` → Position `i+1` or `i-1`: **cost 1**
- This changes parity (even becomes odd, odd becomes even)

### **Optimal Strategy**

1. **Group by Parity**: All chips at even positions can be moved to any even position for free
2. **Group by Parity**: All chips at odd positions can be moved to any odd position for free
3. **Choose Target Parity**: Choose the parity with more chips (majority)
4. **Move Minority**: Move all chips from minority parity to majority parity (cost 1 per chip)
5. **Total Cost**: Number of chips in minority parity

### **Mathematical Proof**

**Claim**: The minimum cost is `min(count_even, count_odd)`.

**Proof**:
- Moving chips within the same parity costs 0
- Moving chips from one parity to the other costs 1 per chip
- To have all chips at the same position, they must all be at the same parity
- We choose the parity with more chips (to minimize moves)
- Cost = number of chips we need to move = `min(count_even, count_odd)`

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of `position`
  - Single pass through the array to count chips by parity
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using two variables (`even`, `odd`)
  - No additional data structures

## Key Points

1. **Parity is Key**: The problem reduces to counting chips by parity
2. **Free Moves**: Moving by 2 positions costs 0 (preserves parity)
3. **Expensive Moves**: Moving by 1 position costs 1 (changes parity)
4. **Greedy Choice**: Always move chips from minority parity to majority parity
5. **Simple Solution**: Just count and return minimum

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: Parity Counting (Current Solution)**
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Best for**: Optimal solution, most efficient

### **Approach 2: Try All Positions**
- **Time**: O(n × m) where m is the range of positions
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Not practical**: Too slow for large position values

### **Approach 3: Dynamic Programming**
- **Time**: O(n × m)
- **Space**: O(m)
- **Overkill**: Not needed, greedy is optimal

## Edge Cases

1. **All chips at same position**: `[1,1,1]` → return 0 (no moves needed)
2. **All chips at even positions**: `[2,4,6]` → return 0 (all same parity)
3. **All chips at odd positions**: `[1,3,5]` → return 0 (all same parity)
4. **Equal counts**: `[1,2]` → return 1 (move one chip)
5. **Large positions**: `[1,1000000000]` → return 1 (parity doesn't depend on magnitude)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not understanding parity**: Trying to calculate actual distances
2. **Wrong counting**: Counting positions instead of chips
3. **Complex solution**: Trying to simulate moves instead of using parity
4. **Variable naming**: The code has swapped variable names (`even` counts odd, `odd` counts even), but logic is correct
5. **Overthinking**: The problem looks complex but has a simple parity-based solution

## Follow-Up: Why Parity Works

**Question**: Why does moving by 2 positions cost 0?

**Answer**: 
- Moving by 2 positions preserves parity
- Even + 2 = Even, Odd + 2 = Odd
- We can move any distance in steps of 2: `i → i+2 → i+4 → ... → i+2k` (all cost 0)
- Therefore, any chip at an even position can reach any even position for free
- Similarly, any chip at an odd position can reach any odd position for free

**Question**: Why does moving by 1 position cost 1?

**Answer**:
- Moving by 1 position changes parity
- Even + 1 = Odd, Odd + 1 = Even
- This is the only way to change parity, so it costs 1
