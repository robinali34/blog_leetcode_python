# [Medium] 1801. Number of Orders in the Backlog

## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `orders`, where `orders[i] = [price_i, amount_i, orderType_i]` denotes that `amount_i` orders have been placed of type `orderType_i` at price `price_i`. The `orderType_i` is:

- `0` if it is a batch of **buy orders**, or
- `1` if it is a batch of **sell orders**.

Note that `orders[i]` represents a batch of `amount_i` independent orders with the same price and type. All orders represented by `orders[i]` will be placed before all orders represented by `orders[i+1]` for all valid `i`.

There is a **backlog** that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:

- If the order is a **buy order**, you look at the **sell order** with the **smallest price** in the backlog. If that sell order's price is **smaller than or equal to** the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.
- Vice versa, if the order is a **sell order**, you look at the **buy order** with the **largest price** in the backlog. If that buy order's price is **larger than or equal to** the current sell order's price, they will match and be executed, and that buy order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the sell order is added to the backlog.

Return *the total **amount** of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input*. Since the number can be large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders in the backlog, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.
- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders in the backlog with price >= 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders in the backlog with price >= 25, so it is added to the backlog.
- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first sell order with price 15 is matched and removed, and 4 is reduced by 1 to 3. The second sell order with price 15 is matched and removed, and 3 is reduced by 2 to 1. The third sell order with price 25 is matched and removed, and 1 is reduced by 1 to 0. The 4 buy orders with price 30 are now added to the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has 5 + 1 = 6 orders. So we return 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]
Output: 999999984
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 10^9 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 10^9 orders are added to the backlog.
- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the smallest price, which is 7, and these 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.
- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The sell order with price 7 should be matched, but since the buy order price is 5 < 7, it is not matched. Instead, 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. This sell order is matched with a buy order of price 5, so 1 buy order is removed, and 999999994 orders remain in the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has (10^9 - 3) + 999999994 = 1999999991 orders. So we return 1999999991 mod 10^9 + 7 = 999999984.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= orders.length <= 10^5`
- `orders[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= price_i, amount_i <= 10^9`
- `orderType_i` is either `0` or `1`.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Order matching**: When does a buy order match with a sell order? (Assumption: Buy order matches sell order if buy price >= sell price, and vice versa - sell matches buy if sell price <= buy price)

2. **Partial matching**: Can orders be partially matched, or must they be fully matched? (Assumption: Orders can be partially matched - we match the minimum of available amounts)

3. **Order priority**: When multiple orders can match, which one should we match first? (Assumption: For buy orders, match with lowest sell price first; for sell orders, match with highest buy price first - greedy matching)

4. **Modulo requirement**: Should the final result be modulo 10^9 + 7? (Assumption: Yes - to prevent integer overflow, return result modulo 10^9 + 7)

5. **Order processing**: Are orders processed in the given order, or can we process them in any order? (Assumption: Process orders sequentially in the given order - this is a simulation problem)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Maintain two lists (one for buy orders, one for sell orders). For each incoming order, iterate through the opposite list to find matching orders. When matching, remove matched orders from the list. This approach is straightforward but has O(n²) complexity since for each order we might scan all existing orders. With up to 10^5 orders, this becomes too slow.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use sorted data structures (like sorted vectors or balanced BSTs) to maintain buy and sell orders. Buy orders should be sorted in descending order of price (highest first), and sell orders in ascending order of price (lowest first). When matching, we can quickly find the best matching order, but updating the data structure after partial matches still requires careful handling. Insertion and removal operations are O(log n), giving O(n log n) overall complexity.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use two priority queues (heaps): a max-heap for buy orders (highest price first) and a min-heap for sell orders (lowest price first). For each incoming order, try to match with orders from the opposite heap. When matching, remove fully matched orders and update partially matched orders. Priority queues provide O(log n) insertion and O(1) access to the best matching order. The key insight is that we only need the best (highest buy or lowest sell) order at any time, which priority queues provide efficiently. This achieves O(n log n) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires efficiently matching buy and sell orders based on price conditions. We need to:
- Keep buy orders in a **max heap** (highest price first)
- Keep sell orders in a **min heap** (lowest price first)
- Match orders when price conditions are met
- Track remaining amounts after partial matches

### Key Insights:

1. **Priority Queues**: Use heaps to efficiently find best matching orders
2. **Buy Orders**: Max heap (highest price first) - want to match with highest buy price
3. **Sell Orders**: Min heap (lowest price first) - want to match with lowest sell price
4. **Matching Logic**: 
   - Buy order matches if `buy_price >= sell_price`
   - Sell order matches if `sell_price <= buy_price`
5. **Partial Matching**: Orders can be partially matched, remaining amount stays in backlog

## Solution

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def getNumberOfBacklogOrders(self, orders):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        buy = []   # max heap (use negative price)
        sell = []  # min heap
        
        for o in orders:
            price, amount, type = o[0], o[1], o[2]
            
            if type == 0:
                while amount > 0 and sell and sell[0][0] <= price:
                    sellPrice, sellAmount = heapq.heappop(sell)
                    matched = min(amount, sellAmount)
                    amount -= matched
                    sellAmount -= matched
                    
                    if sellAmount > 0:
                        heapq.heappush(sell, (sellPrice, sellAmount))
                
                if amount > 0:
                    heapq.heappush(buy, (-price, amount))
            
            else:
                while amount > 0 and buy and -buy[0][0] >= price:
                    buyPrice, buyAmount = heapq.heappop(buy)
                    buyPrice = -buyPrice
                    matched = min(amount, buyAmount)
                    amount -= matched
                    buyAmount -= matched
                    
                    if buyAmount > 0:
                        heapq.heappush(buy, (-buyPrice, buyAmount))
                
                if amount > 0:
                    heapq.heappush(sell, (price, amount))
        
        rtn = 0
        
        while buy:
            rtn = (rtn + buy[0][1]) % MOD
            heapq.heappop(buy)
        
        while sell:
            rtn = (rtn + sell[0][1]) % MOD
            heapq.heappop(sell)
        
        return rtn
```

### Algorithm Explanation:

#### **Data Structures:**

1. **`buy`**: Max heap (priority queue) storing `{price, amount}` pairs
   - Highest price orders are at the top
   - Used to match with sell orders

2. **`sell`**: Min heap (priority queue) storing `{price, amount}` pairs
   - Lowest price orders are at the top
   - Used to match with buy orders

#### **Processing Buy Orders (type == 0):**

1. **Match with Sell Orders**:
   - While `amount > 0` and sell orders exist with `sellPrice <= buyPrice`:
     - Pop the smallest sell order
     - Calculate matched amount: `min(amount, sellAmount)`
     - Reduce both amounts by matched quantity
     - If sell order has remaining amount, push it back

2. **Add to Backlog**:
   - If buy order has remaining amount after matching, add to buy heap

#### **Processing Sell Orders (type == 1):**

1. **Match with Buy Orders**:
   - While `amount > 0` and buy orders exist with `buyPrice >= sellPrice`:
     - Pop the largest buy order
     - Calculate matched amount: `min(amount, buyAmount)`
     - Reduce both amounts by matched quantity
     - If buy order has remaining amount, push it back

2. **Add to Backlog**:
   - If sell order has remaining amount after matching, add to sell heap

#### **Calculate Result:**

1. Sum all remaining amounts in buy heap
2. Sum all remaining amounts in sell heap
3. Return total modulo `10^9 + 7`

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]`

```
Step 1: Process [10,5,0] (Buy 5 at price 10)
  sell heap empty → add to buy heap
  buy: {(10, 5)}

Step 2: Process [15,2,1] (Sell 2 at price 15)
  buy.top() = (10, 5), but 10 < 15 → no match
  add to sell heap
  buy: {(10, 5)}, sell: {(15, 2)}

Step 3: Process [25,1,1] (Sell 1 at price 25)
  buy.top() = (10, 5), but 10 < 25 → no match
  add to sell heap
  buy: {(10, 5)}, sell: {(15, 2), (25, 1)}

Step 4: Process [30,4,0] (Buy 4 at price 30)
  Match with sell.top() = (15, 2):
    matched = min(4, 2) = 2
    amount = 4 - 2 = 2
    sellAmount = 2 - 2 = 0 → remove from heap
  Match with sell.top() = (25, 1):
    matched = min(2, 1) = 1
    amount = 2 - 1 = 1
    sellAmount = 1 - 1 = 0 → remove from heap
  Remaining amount = 1 → add to buy heap
  buy: {(10, 5), (30, 1)}, sell: {}

Result: 5 + 1 = 6 ✓
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
  - Processing each order: O(n)
  - Heap operations (push/pop): O(log n) per operation
  - Matching may require multiple heap operations per order
  - Worst case: O(n log n) when many matches occur

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - Buy heap: O(n) in worst case
  - Sell heap: O(n) in worst case
  - Overall: O(n)

## Key Insights

1. **Heap Selection**: 
   - Max heap for buy orders (want highest price)
   - Min heap for sell orders (want lowest price)
2. **Matching Strategy**: 
   - Always match with best available price
   - Partial matching is allowed
3. **Order Processing**: 
   - Process orders sequentially
   - Match greedily until no more matches possible
4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: 
   - Use modulo when summing to prevent overflow
   - Apply modulo at each addition step

## Edge Cases

1. **No matches**: All orders added to backlog
   - `orders = [[10,5,0],[20,3,1]]` → buy: 5, sell: 3, total: 8

2. **Complete matching**: All orders matched
   - `orders = [[10,5,0],[10,5,1]]` → buy: 0, sell: 0, total: 0

3. **Partial matching**: Some orders partially matched
   - `orders = [[10,5,0],[8,3,1]]` → buy: 2, sell: 0, total: 2

4. **Large amounts**: Handle modulo correctly
   - Example 2 shows handling of 10^9 amounts

5. **Empty backlog**: No orders remain
   - All orders matched perfectly

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong heap type**: Using min heap for buy orders or max heap for sell orders
2. **Incorrect matching condition**: 
   - Buy matches when `buyPrice >= sellPrice` (not `>`)
   - Sell matches when `sellPrice <= buyPrice` (not `<`)
3. **Not handling partial matches**: Forgetting to push back remaining amounts
4. **Modulo overflow**: Not applying modulo during accumulation
5. **Empty heap access**: Not checking if heap is empty before accessing top
6. **Integer overflow**: Not using `long long` for result accumulation

## Alternative Approaches

### Using Separate Structs for Orders

```python
struct Order :
price, amount
Order(p, a) : price(p), amount(a) :
# Custom comparators
buyCmp = [](Order a, Order b) :
return a.price < b.price # Max heap
sellCmp = [](Order a, Order b) :
return a.price > b.price # Min heap
heapq[Order, list[Order>, decltype(buyCmp)> buy(buyCmp)
heapq[Order, list[Order>, decltype(sellCmp)> sell(sellCmp)

```

**Pros**: More structured, clearer intent  
**Cons**: More verbose, slightly more overhead
