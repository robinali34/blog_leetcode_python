# [Easy] 408. Valid Word Abbreviation

A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent, non-empty substrings with their lengths. The lengths should not have leading zeros.

For example, a string such as `"substitution"` could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):

- `"s10n"` (`"s" + "ubstitutio" + "n"`)
- `"sub4u4"` (`"sub" + "stit" + "u" + "tion"`)
- `"12"` (`"substitution"`)
- `"s55n"` (`"s" + "ubsti" + "tuti" + "on"` - invalid, adjacent substrings)
- `"s010n"` (`"s" + "010" + "n"` - invalid, leading zeros)

Given a string `word` and an abbreviation `abbr`, return whether the string matches the given abbreviation.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: word = "internationalization", abbr = "i12iz4n"
Output: true
Explanation: 
  "i12iz4n" represents:
  - "i" (1 character)
  - "12" (skip 12 characters: "nternational")
  - "iz" (2 characters: "iz")
  - "4" (skip 4 characters: "atio")
  - "n" (1 character: "n")
  Total: 1 + 12 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 20 characters ✓
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: word = "apple", abbr = "a2e"
Output: false
Explanation: 
  "a2e" represents:
  - "a" (1 character)
  - "2" (skip 2 characters: "pp")
  - "e" (1 character: should be "e" but we're at position 4, which is "e" ✓)
  Wait, let me recalculate: "a" at pos 0, skip 2 → pos 3, "e" at pos 3... but "e" is at pos 4
  Actually: "a" at pos 0, skip 2 → pos 2 ("p"), then "e" should be at pos 4, mismatch ✗
  
  Actually the abbreviation is invalid because after skipping 2 from position 1, 
  we're at position 3, but "e" is at position 4.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: word = "substitution", abbr = "s010n"
Output: false
Explanation: Leading zeros are not allowed.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: word = "substitution", abbr = "s55n"
Output: false
Explanation: Cannot have adjacent number replacements (would need to be "s5u5n").
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= word.length <= 20`
- `word` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= abbr.length <= 10`
- `abbr` consists of lowercase English letters and digits.
- `abbr` does not contain any leading zeros.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Abbreviation format**: What is the abbreviation format? (Assumption: Mix of letters and numbers - numbers represent skipped characters, letters represent actual characters)

2. **Validation rules**: What makes an abbreviation valid? (Assumption: Abbreviation must match word exactly - numbers skip that many characters, letters must match)

3. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Boolean - true if abbreviation is valid, false otherwise)

4. **Leading zeros**: Are leading zeros allowed? (Assumption: No - per constraints, no leading zeros in abbreviation)

5. **Number parsing**: How are numbers parsed? (Assumption: Consecutive digits form a number - skip that many characters in word)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)**

Expand the abbreviation: parse the abbreviation, convert numbers to skipped characters, and reconstruct the full string. Then compare the reconstructed string with the original word character by character. This approach works but requires building an intermediate string, which uses extra space.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)**

Use two pointers: one for the word and one for the abbreviation. Parse the abbreviation character by character. When encountering a digit, parse the number and advance the word pointer by that amount. When encountering a letter, compare with the current word character. This avoids building an intermediate string but requires careful handling of number parsing and boundary checks.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)**

Use single-pass with position tracking: maintain pointers `i` for word and `j` for abbreviation. While both pointers are valid, if `abbr[j]` is a digit, parse the number (handling consecutive digits) and advance `i` by that amount. If `abbr[j]` is a letter, compare with `word[i]` and advance both pointers. After processing, check if both pointers reached the end. This achieves O(n) time with O(1) space, which is optimal. The key insight is that we can validate the abbreviation by simulating the expansion process without actually building the expanded string.

## Solution: Single-Pass with Position Tracking

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of `abbr`  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

The key insight is to track the current position in the word while parsing the abbreviation. When we encounter a letter, we verify it matches. When we encounter digits, we parse the number and skip that many characters.

### Solution: Position Tracking Approach

```python
class Solution:
def validWordAbbreviation(self, word, abbr):
    len = abbr.length(), wordLen = word.length()
    abbrLen = 0, num = 0
    for(i = 0 i < len i += 1) :
    if abbr[i] >= 'a'  and  abbr[i] <= 'z':
        # Letter: add accumulated number and current letter
        abbrLen += num + 1
        num = 0
        # Check bounds and character match
        if abbrLen > wordLen  or  abbr[i] != word[abbrLen - 1]:
            return False
         else :
        # Digit: check for leading zero and build number
        if not num  and  abbr[i] == '0':
            return False
        num = num  10 + abbr[i] - '0'
# Final check: accumulated length should match word length
return abbrLen + num == wordLen

```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Key Insight: Track Word Position

**Variables:**
- `abbrLen`: Current position in the word (characters processed so far)
- `num`: Current number being parsed from abbreviation

**Logic:**
- When we see a **letter**: Add `num` (skip) + 1 (current letter) to `abbrLen`, verify match
- When we see a **digit**: Build the number, check for leading zeros
- At the end: `abbrLen + num` should equal `wordLen`

### Step-by-Step Example: `word = "internationalization"`, `abbr = "i12iz4n"`

```
Initial: abbrLen = 0, num = 0

i=0: 'i' (letter)
  abbrLen = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
  num = 0
  Check: word[0] == 'i' ✓
  abbrLen = 1

i=1: '1' (digit)
  num = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1

i=2: '2' (digit)
  num = 1 * 10 + 2 = 12

i=3: 'i' (letter)
  abbrLen = 1 + 12 + 1 = 14
  num = 0
  Check: word[13] == 'i' ✓ (position 14 - 1 = 13)
  abbrLen = 14

i=4: 'z' (letter)
  abbrLen = 14 + 0 + 1 = 15
  num = 0
  Check: word[14] == 'z' ✓
  abbrLen = 15

i=5: '4' (digit)
  num = 0 * 10 + 4 = 4

i=6: 'n' (letter)
  abbrLen = 15 + 4 + 1 = 20
  num = 0
  Check: word[19] == 'n' ✓
  abbrLen = 20

Final: abbrLen + num = 20 + 0 = 20 == wordLen (20) ✓
```

**Visual Representation:**
```
word:  i n t e r n a t i o n a l i z a t i o n
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

abbr:  i 12 i z 4 n
       │ │  │ │ │ │
       │ │  │ │ │ └─> pos 19: 'n' ✓
       │ │  │ │ └───> skip 4: pos 15→19
       │ │  │ └─────> pos 14: 'z' ✓
       │ │  └───────> pos 13: 'i' ✓
       │ └───────────> skip 12: pos 1→13
       └─────────────> pos 0: 'i' ✓
```

## Key Insights

1. **Position tracking**: Track where we are in the word (`abbrLen`)
2. **Number accumulation**: Build multi-digit numbers digit by digit
3. **Leading zero check**: Reject if digit is '0' when `num == 0`
4. **Final validation**: Ensure total length matches word length
5. **Bounds checking**: Verify we don't exceed word length

## Algorithm Breakdown

### Letter Handling

```python
if abbr[i] >= 'a'  and  abbr[i] <= 'z':
    abbrLen += num + 1
    num = 0
    if abbrLen > wordLen  or  abbr[i] != word[abbrLen - 1]:
        return False




```

**Why:**
- `abbrLen += num + 1`: Add skipped characters (`num`) + current letter (1)
- Reset `num = 0`: Number has been consumed
- `abbrLen - 1`: Convert to 0-indexed position
- Check bounds: `abbrLen > wordLen` prevents overflow
- Check match: Current abbreviation letter must match word letter

### Digit Handling

```python
else:
    if not num  and  abbr[i] == '0':
        return False
    num = num  10 + abbr[i] - '0'

```

**Why:**
- `!num && abbr[i] == '0'`: Leading zero check (first digit cannot be '0')
- `num * 10 + digit`: Build number from left to right
- Don't update `abbrLen` yet: Number might continue

### Final Check

```python
return abbrLen + num == wordLen




```

**Why:**
- After processing all characters, `num` might still contain unprocessed skip count
- `abbrLen + num` should equal total word length
- Ensures we've processed exactly the right number of characters

## Edge Cases

1. **Leading zeros**: `"s010n"` → invalid (leading zero)
2. **Exact match**: `"word"` and `"4"` → valid (skip all 4 characters)
3. **No skips**: `"word"` and `"word"` → valid (all letters)
4. **Overflow**: `"word"` and `"w5d"` → invalid (skip 5 but only 3 chars remain)
5. **Underflow**: `"word"` and `"w2d"` → invalid (skip 2, but 'd' doesn't match position)
6. **Empty abbreviation**: Not possible per constraints

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 2: Two-Pointer Method

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

```python
class Solution:
def validWordAbbreviation(self, word, abbr):
    i = 0, j = 0  # i for word, j for abbr
    while i < word.length()  and  j < abbr.length():
        if abbr[j] >= 'a'  and  abbr[j] <= 'z':
            # Letter: must match
            if word[i] != abbr[j]:
                return False
            i += 1
            j += 1
             else :
            # Digit: parse number and skip
            if abbr[j] == '0':
                return False  # Leading zero
            num = 0
            while j < abbr.length()  and  isdigit(abbr[j]):
                num = num  10 + (abbr[j] - '0')
                j += 1
            i += num  # Skip num characters in word
    return i == word.length()  and  j == abbr.length()

```

**Pros:**
- More intuitive: two pointers for word and abbreviation
- Easier to understand flow

**Cons:**
- Slightly more verbose
- Same complexity as single-pass approach

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Position Tracking** | O(n) | O(1) | Single pass, concise | Less intuitive |
| **Two-Pointer** | O(n) | O(1) | More intuitive | Slightly more code |

## Implementation Details

### Why `abbrLen - 1` for Index?

**Position vs Index:**
- `abbrLen` tracks **position** (1-indexed count of characters)
- Array access needs **index** (0-indexed)
- `word[abbrLen - 1]` converts position to index

**Example:**
```
After processing "i", abbrLen = 1 (1 character processed)
word[0] is the first character, so word[abbrLen - 1] = word[0] ✓
```

### Leading Zero Detection

```python
if not num  and  abbr[i] == '0':
    return False




```

**Why this works:**
- `!num` means we haven't started building a number yet
- If first digit is '0', it's a leading zero → invalid
- Valid numbers: "1", "12", "123" (no leading zeros)
- Invalid: "01", "012" (leading zeros)

### Number Building

```python
num = num  10 + abbr[i] - '0'

```

**How it works:**
- Start with `num = 0`
- For each digit: multiply by 10 and add new digit
- Example: "12" → `num = 0*10+1 = 1`, then `num = 1*10+2 = 12`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Off-by-one errors**: Forgetting `abbrLen - 1` for array indexing
2. **Leading zeros**: Not checking for '0' as first digit
3. **Final check**: Forgetting to add remaining `num` at the end
4. **Bounds checking**: Not verifying `abbrLen <= wordLen`
5. **Number parsing**: Not handling multi-digit numbers correctly
6. **Reset num**: Forgetting to reset `num = 0` after processing letter

## Optimization Tips

1. **Early termination**: Return false immediately on mismatch
2. **Single pass**: Process abbreviation in one iteration
3. **Minimal variables**: Only track necessary state

## Step-by-Step Trace: `word = "apple"`, `abbr = "a2e"`

```
Initial: abbrLen = 0, num = 0, wordLen = 5

i=0: 'a' (letter)
  abbrLen = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
  num = 0
  Check: word[0] == 'a' ✓
  abbrLen = 1

i=1: '2' (digit)
  num = 0 * 10 + 2 = 2

i=2: 'e' (letter)
  abbrLen = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
  num = 0
  Check: word[3] == 'e' ✗ (word[3] = 'l', not 'e')
  Return false
```

**Why it fails:**
- After 'a' at position 0, skip 2 → position 2
- 'e' should be at position 2, but word[2] = 'p'
- Actually, 'e' is at position 4, so abbreviation is invalid

## Why This Solution Works

**Correctness:**
- Tracks exact position in word: `abbrLen` counts characters processed
- Validates each letter: Ensures abbreviation matches word
- Handles numbers correctly: Parses multi-digit numbers
- Prevents leading zeros: Rejects invalid abbreviations
- Final validation: Ensures total length matches

**Efficiency:**
- Single pass: O(n) where n is abbreviation length
- Constant space: Only a few variables
- Early termination: Returns false immediately on error
