# 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

## Problem Statement

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return *the **minimum number of arrows** that must be shot to burst all balloons*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= points.length <= 10^5`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-2^31 <= xstart < xend <= 2^31 - 1`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Balloon representation**: How are balloons represented? (Assumption: [xstart, xend] - horizontal span of balloon)

2. **Arrow shooting**: How do arrows work? (Assumption: Arrow shot at x-coordinate bursts all balloons that span that x-coordinate)

3. **Optimization goal**: What are we optimizing for? (Assumption: Minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - minimum number of arrows)

5. **Overlapping balloons**: Can one arrow burst multiple balloons? (Assumption: Yes - if balloons overlap, one arrow can burst all overlapping balloons)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Try all possible arrow positions. For each balloon, we could shoot an arrow at any x-coordinate within its span. Try all combinations of arrow positions and find the minimum number needed. This approach has exponential complexity and is infeasible. The challenge is that we need to find the optimal set of arrow positions that cover all balloons.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use a greedy approach: sort balloons by start position. For each balloon, if it doesn't overlap with the current arrow position, shoot a new arrow at its end position (or start position). However, choosing where to shoot the arrow (start vs end) requires careful consideration. Shooting at the end position maximizes the chance of hitting overlapping balloons.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Sort balloons by end position. Greedily shoot arrows: for the first balloon, shoot an arrow at its end position. For subsequent balloons, if they start after the current arrow position, they're already burst. Otherwise, shoot a new arrow at the current balloon's end position. This ensures we always shoot at the rightmost position that can burst the current balloon, maximizing overlap coverage. This achieves O(n log n) time for sorting plus O(n) for processing, which is optimal. The key insight is that sorting by end position and shooting at end positions maximizes the number of balloons each arrow can burst.

## Solution Approach

This is a **greedy interval scheduling** problem similar to "Non-overlapping Intervals". The key insight is to **sort balloons by end coordinate** and shoot arrows at the end of each group of overlapping balloons.

### Key Insights:

1. **Sort by End Coordinate**: Sort balloons by their end coordinate (xend)
2. **Greedy Choice**: Shoot arrow at the end of the first balloon in each group
3. **Overlap Detection**: Balloons overlap if `start <= previous_end`
4. **Boundary Touch**: Balloons touching at boundary can be burst by same arrow
5. **Optimal**: This greedy strategy minimizes number of arrows

### Algorithm:

1. **Sort**: Sort balloons by end coordinate
2. **Track**: Keep track of the arrow position (end of last burst balloon)
3. **Iterate**: For each balloon, if it doesn't overlap with current arrow position, shoot new arrow
4. **Count**: Return the number of arrows needed

## Solution

### **Solution: Greedy with End Coordinate Sorting**

```python
class Solution:
def findMinArrowShots(self, points):
    if (len(points) == 0) return 0
    sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [](u, v):
    return u[1] < v[1]
    )
    pos = points[0][1]
    arrows = 1
    for ballon in points:
        if ballon[0] > pos:
            pos = ballon[1]
            arrows += 1
    return arrows
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Edge Case (Line 4)**:
   - If points array is empty, return 0 (no arrows needed)

2. **Sort by End Coordinate (Lines 5-7)**:
   - Sort balloons by their end coordinate (`u[1] < v[1]`)
   - This ensures we process balloons with earlier end coordinates first
   - **Key**: Sorting by end coordinate allows greedy choice to be optimal

3. **Initialize (Lines 8-9)**:
   - `pos`: Position of the last arrow shot (end coordinate of first balloon)
   - `arrows`: Number of arrows needed (start with 1 for the first balloon)

4. **Process Remaining Balloons (Lines 10-14)**:
   - **For each balloon** starting from index 1:
     - **If doesn't overlap**: `ballon[0] > pos`
       - Current balloon's start is after last arrow position
       - Shoot new arrow at this balloon's end coordinate
       - Update `pos` to current balloon's end
       - Increment `arrows`
     - **Else**: Balloon overlaps with current arrow position
       - Current arrow can burst this balloon (no new arrow needed)
       - Don't update `pos` (keep shooting at same position)

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**Example 1: `points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]`**

**After sorting by end coordinate:**
```
Original: [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Sorted:   [[1,6], [2,8], [7,12], [10,16]]
          [1,6] end=6
          [2,8] end=8
          [7,12] end=12
          [10,16] end=16
```

**Execution:**
```
Initial: pos = 6 (from [1,6]), arrows = 1

i=1: [2,8]
  Check: 2 > 6? No (overlaps, arrow at x=6 can burst it)
  No new arrow needed

i=2: [7,12]
  Check: 7 > 6? Yes (doesn't overlap)
  Shoot new arrow: pos = 12, arrows = 2

i=3: [10,16]
  Check: 10 > 12? No (overlaps, arrow at x=12 can burst it)
  No new arrow needed

Result: 2 arrows
Arrow positions: x=6 (bursts [1,6], [2,8]), x=12 (bursts [7,12], [10,16])
```

**Example 2: `points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]`**

**After sorting by end coordinate:**
```
Already sorted: [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7,8]]
```

**Execution:**
```
Initial: pos = 2 (from [1,2]), arrows = 1

i=1: [3,4]
  Check: 3 > 2? Yes (doesn't overlap)
  Shoot new arrow: pos = 4, arrows = 2

i=2: [5,6]
  Check: 5 > 4? Yes (doesn't overlap)
  Shoot new arrow: pos = 6, arrows = 3

i=3: [7,8]
  Check: 7 > 6? Yes (doesn't overlap)
  Shoot new arrow: pos = 8, arrows = 4

Result: 4 arrows (one for each balloon)
```

**Example 3: `points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]`**

**After sorting by end coordinate:**
```
Already sorted: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5]]
```

**Execution:**
```
Initial: pos = 2 (from [1,2]), arrows = 1

i=1: [2,3]
  Check: 2 > 2? No (overlaps, arrow at x=2 can burst it)
  No new arrow needed

i=2: [3,4]
  Check: 3 > 2? Yes (doesn't overlap)
  Shoot new arrow: pos = 4, arrows = 2

i=3: [4,5]
  Check: 4 > 4? No (overlaps, arrow at x=4 can burst it)
  No new arrow needed

Result: 2 arrows
Arrow positions: x=2 (bursts [1,2], [2,3]), x=4 (bursts [3,4], [4,5])
```

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Why Sort by End Coordinate?**

Sorting by end coordinate is crucial for the greedy strategy:

1. **Maximize Coverage**: Shooting at the end of a balloon maximizes the number of overlapping balloons we can burst
2. **Optimal Choice**: This choice is always optimal (doesn't prevent optimal solutions later)
3. **Greedy Property**: Shooting at the earliest end coordinate leaves maximum room for future balloons

**Counter-example (sorting by start coordinate):**
```
Balloons: [[1,10], [2,3], [4,5]]

Sort by start: [[1,10], [2,3], [4,5]]
  Shoot at x=10 → bursts [1,10]
  [2,3] overlaps (2 <= 10) → already burst
  [4,5] overlaps (4 <= 10) → already burst
  Arrows: 1

Sort by end: [[2,3], [4,5], [1,10]]
  Shoot at x=3 → bursts [2,3]
  [4,5] doesn't overlap (4 > 3) → shoot at x=5
  [1,10] overlaps (1 <= 5) → already burst
  Arrows: 2

Wait, this doesn't show the issue. Let me think of a better example...

Actually, sorting by end is correct. The issue with sorting by start would be:
[[1,6], [2,3], [4,5]]

Sort by start: [[1,6], [2,3], [4,5]]
  Shoot at x=6 → bursts all (optimal, 1 arrow)

Sort by end: [[2,3], [4,5], [1,6]]
  Shoot at x=3 → bursts [2,3]
  [4,5] doesn't overlap (4 > 3) → shoot at x=5
  [1,6] overlaps (1 <= 5) → already burst
  Arrows: 2 (suboptimal!)

Hmm, but wait - if we shoot at x=6 in the sorted-by-end approach, we'd get:
  Shoot at x=6 → bursts [2,3], [1,6]
  [4,5] overlaps (4 <= 6) → already burst
  Arrows: 1 (optimal!)

The key is that we shoot at the END of the first balloon, which is x=3, not x=6. But [1,6] starts at 1, which is <= 3, so it should be burst. But [1,6] ends at 6, which is after 3, so if we shoot at x=3, we can't burst [1,6] because 3 is not in [1,6]... wait, 3 IS in [1,6] (1 <= 3 <= 6), so it should work.

Actually, I think the algorithm is correct. Let me verify with the actual execution:
- After sorting by end: [[2,3], [4,5], [1,6]]
- pos = 3, arrows = 1
- [4,5]: 4 > 3? Yes → new arrow at x=5, arrows=2
- [1,6]: 1 > 5? No → overlaps, already burst by arrow at x=5

But wait, arrow at x=5 cannot burst [1,6] because 5 is in [1,6]? Yes, 1 <= 5 <= 6, so it can burst it. So the algorithm is correct.

The key insight is that we shoot at the END of balloons, and a balloon [a,b] can be burst by an arrow at x if a <= x <= b. So if we shoot at x=5, it can burst [1,6] because 1 <= 5 <= 6.
```

### **Overlap Detection**

Two balloons `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` can be burst by the same arrow if they overlap:
```
They overlap if: c <= b (current start <= previous end)
```

**Why `>` not `>=`?**
- We check `ballon[0] > pos` to see if we need a new arrow
- If `ballon[0] <= pos`, the balloon overlaps with the current arrow position
- The arrow at `pos` can burst this balloon (since `ballon[0] <= pos <= ballon[1]`)

### **Greedy Strategy**

The algorithm uses a greedy strategy:
1. **Sort by end coordinate**: Process balloons with earlier end coordinates first
2. **Shoot at end**: Always shoot arrow at the end coordinate of the first balloon in a group
3. **Maximize coverage**: This maximizes the number of overlapping balloons burst by one arrow

This minimizes the number of arrows needed.

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - **Sorting**: O(n log n) where n is the number of balloons
  - **Iteration**: O(n) - single pass through sorted balloons
  - **Total**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using a few variables
  - Sorting is in-place (or O(n) if not in-place, but typically O(1) extra space)

## Key Points

1. **Sort by End Coordinate**: Critical for greedy strategy to work
2. **Greedy Choice**: Shoot arrow at end of first balloon in each group
3. **Overlap Check**: Use `>` to check if new arrow needed
4. **Boundary Touch**: Balloons touching at boundary can be burst by same arrow
5. **Optimal**: Greedy approach finds optimal solution

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: Greedy with End Coordinate Sorting (Current Solution)**
- **Time**: O(n log n)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Best for**: Optimal solution, most efficient

### **Approach 2: Sort by Start Coordinate**
- **Time**: O(n log n)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Problem**: Doesn't guarantee optimal solution in all cases
- **Example**: May use more arrows than necessary

### **Approach 3: Dynamic Programming**
- **Time**: O(n²)
- **Space**: O(n)
- **Use when**: Need to track which balloons are burst by which arrows
- **Idea**: `dp[i]` = min arrows to burst first i balloons

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty array**: `[]` → return 0
2. **Single balloon**: `[[1,2]]` → return 1
3. **No overlaps**: `[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]` → return 3
4. **All overlap**: `[[1,5],[2,6],[3,7]]` → return 1
5. **Boundary touch**: `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]` → return 2
6. **Nested balloons**: `[[1,10],[2,3],[4,5]]` → return 1

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong sort key**: Sorting by start coordinate instead of end coordinate
2. **Wrong overlap condition**: Using `>=` instead of `>`
3. **Not handling empty input**: Forgetting edge case
4. **Wrong initialization**: Not initializing `pos` and `arrows` correctly
5. **Off-by-one error**: Starting loop from wrong index

## Comparison with LC 435

**LC 435 (Non-overlapping Intervals):**
- Goal: Remove minimum intervals to make non-overlapping
- Overlap check: `start < previous_end` (use `<`)
- Boundary touch: Considered non-overlapping

**LC 452 (Minimum Arrows to Burst Balloons):**
- Goal: Find minimum arrows to burst all balloons
- Overlap check: `start > previous_end` (use `>`)
- Boundary touch: Can be burst by same arrow (considered overlapping)

The key difference is in the overlap condition due to the problem requirements.
