# 418. Sentence Screen Fitting

## Problem Statement

Given a `rows x cols` screen and a sentence represented as a list of strings, return *the number of times the given sentence can be fitted on the screen*.

The order of words in the sentence must remain unchanged, and a word cannot be split into two lines. A single space must separate two consecutive words on a line.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: sentence = ["hello","world"], rows = 2, cols = 8
Output: 1
Explanation:
hello---
world---
The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: sentence = ["a", "bcd", "e"], rows = 3, cols = 6
Output: 2
Explanation:
a-bcd-
e-a---
bcd-e-
The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: sentence = ["i","had","apple","pie"], rows = 4, cols = 5
Output: 1
Explanation:
i-had
apple
pie-i
had--
The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= sentence.length <= 100`
- `1 <= sentence[i].length <= 10`
- `1 <= rows, cols <= 2 * 10^4`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Screen layout**: How is the screen laid out? (Assumption: rows x cols grid - words are placed left to right, wrapping to next row when needed)

2. **Word placement**: How are words placed? (Assumption: Words separated by single space, words don't wrap - whole word must fit on same row)

3. **Sentence repetition**: Can sentence repeat? (Assumption: Yes - sentence can be repeated multiple times to fill screen)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - number of times sentence can be fitted on screen)

5. **Space handling**: How are spaces handled? (Assumption: Single space between words, spaces at end of row are allowed)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Simulate each row character by character: for each row, try to fit words one by one, checking if each word fits with a space. When a word doesn't fit, move to the next row. Count how many complete sentences fit across all rows. This approach has O(rows × cols) time complexity, which is too slow for large inputs.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Concatenate the sentence into a single string with spaces, then simulate row by row by tracking a pointer in the concatenated string. For each row, try to fit as many characters as possible, wrapping to the next row when needed. Count complete sentences. This reduces some overhead but still requires O(rows × cols) time in worst case.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming to precompute results: for each starting word position, compute how many complete sentences fit in one row and which word starts the next row. Store these in `dp[i]` and `next[i]` arrays. Then simulate rows using these precomputed values. This achieves O(N × cols + rows) time: O(N × cols) for precomputation and O(rows) for simulation. The key insight is that starting positions repeat (since sentences repeat), so we can reuse precomputed results instead of recalculating for each row.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires fitting a sentence on a screen row by row, where words cannot be split and must be separated by spaces. We can solve this efficiently using **dynamic programming** to precompute how many complete sentences fit starting from each word position.

### Key Insights:

1. **DP Precomputation**: For each starting word, compute how many complete sentences fit in one row
2. **Next Word Tracking**: Track which word starts the next row after fitting current row
3. **Row Simulation**: Simulate each row using precomputed values
4. **Optimization**: Avoid recomputing for same starting positions

### Algorithm:

1. **Precompute DP**: For each word as starting position, calculate sentences and next word
2. **Simulate Rows**: For each row, use DP to get sentences and move to next word
3. **Accumulate Count**: Sum up complete sentences across all rows

## Solution

### **Solution: Dynamic Programming with Next Word Tracking**

```python
class Solution:
    def wordsTyping(self, sentence, rows, cols):
        n = len(sentence)

        dp = [0] * n
        nxt = [0] * n

        for i in range(n):
            ptr = i
            used = 0
            cnt = 0
            cur = cols

            while cur >= len(sentence[ptr]):
                cur -= len(sentence[ptr]) + 1
                ptr += 1

                if ptr == n:
                    ptr = 0
                    cnt += 1

            dp[i] = cnt
            nxt[i] = ptr

        total = 0
        cur = 0

        for _ in range(rows):
            total += dp[cur]
            cur = nxt[cur]

        return total
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Initialize DP Arrays (Lines 5-6)**:
   - `dp[i]`: Number of complete sentences that fit in one row starting from word `i`
   - `next[i]`: Index of word that starts the next row after fitting one row starting from word `i`

2. **Precompute for Each Starting Word (Lines 7-18)**:
   - For each word `i` as starting position:
     - Initialize: `count = 0` (complete sentences), `ptr = i` (current word), `cur = cols` (remaining columns)
     - **Fit words**: While current word fits in remaining space:
       - Subtract word length + 1 (space): `cur -= sentence[ptr].size() + 1`
       - Move to next word: `ptr++`
       - **Complete sentence**: If `ptr == N`, increment count and reset to 0
     - Store results: `dp[i] = count`, `next[i] = ptr`

3. **Simulate All Rows (Lines 20-24)**:
   - Start with `cur = 0` (first word)
   - For each row:
     - Add complete sentences: `count += dp[cur]`
     - Move to next starting word: `cur = next[cur]`
   - Return total count

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `sentence = ["a", "bcd", "e"], rows = 3, cols = 6`:**

```
Step 1: Precompute DP arrays

Starting from word 0 ("a"):
  cur = 6, ptr = 0
  "a" fits: cur = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4, ptr = 1
  "bcd" fits: cur = 4 - 3 - 1 = 0, ptr = 2
  "e" doesn't fit (need 1 + 1 = 2, but cur = 0)
  ptr = 2, count = 0 (no complete sentence)
  dp[0] = 0, next[0] = 2

Starting from word 1 ("bcd"):
  cur = 6, ptr = 1
  "bcd" fits: cur = 6 - 3 - 1 = 2, ptr = 2
  "e" fits: cur = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0, ptr = 0 (wrapped)
  count = 1 (one complete sentence)
  "a" doesn't fit (need 1 + 1 = 2, but cur = 0)
  dp[1] = 1, next[1] = 0

Starting from word 2 ("e"):
  cur = 6, ptr = 2
  "e" fits: cur = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4, ptr = 0 (wrapped)
  count = 1
  "a" fits: cur = 4 - 1 - 1 = 2, ptr = 1
  "bcd" doesn't fit (need 3 + 1 = 4, but cur = 2)
  dp[2] = 1, next[2] = 1

dp = [0, 1, 1]
next = [2, 0, 1]

Step 2: Simulate rows

Row 0: cur = 0
  count += dp[0] = 0
  cur = next[0] = 2

Row 1: cur = 2
  count += dp[2] = 1
  cur = next[2] = 1

Row 2: cur = 1
  count += dp[1] = 1
  cur = next[1] = 0

Total count = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

Visual representation:
Row 0: a-bcd-  (starts with "a", ends at "bcd", next starts with "e")
Row 1: e-a---  (starts with "e", completes sentence, next starts with "bcd")
Row 2: bcd-e-  (starts with "bcd", completes sentence, next starts with "a")
```

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Key Insight: DP Precomputation**

Instead of simulating each row character by character, we precompute:
- **How many complete sentences** fit starting from each word
- **Which word starts the next row** after fitting one row

This allows O(1) lookup per row instead of O(cols) simulation.

### **DP State Definition**

**`dp[i]`**: Number of complete sentences that fit in one row when starting from word `i`

**`next[i]`**: Index of word that starts the next row after fitting one row starting from word `i`

### **Why This Works**

1. **Repetitive Pattern**: Sentence repeats, so starting positions repeat
2. **State Reuse**: Same starting word always leads to same result
3. **Efficient Lookup**: O(1) per row instead of O(cols) simulation
4. **Accumulation**: Sum DP values across all rows

## Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity:** O(N × cols + rows)
- **Precomputation**: O(N × cols) - for each word, simulate up to cols characters
- **Row simulation**: O(rows) - one lookup per row
- **Total**: O(N × cols + rows) where N = sentence length

### **Space Complexity:** O(N)
- **DP arrays**: O(N) for `dp` and `next`
- **Total**: O(N)

## Key Points

1. **DP Precomputation**: Precompute results for each starting word
2. **Next Word Tracking**: Track which word starts next row
3. **Row Simulation**: Use precomputed values for each row
4. **Efficient**: O(rows) for row simulation instead of O(rows × cols)
5. **Space Optimization**: Only store O(N) state

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: DP with Next Tracking (Current Solution)**
- **Time**: O(N × cols + rows)
- **Space**: O(N)
- **Best for**: Optimal solution with precomputation

### **Approach 2: Character-by-Character Simulation**
- **Time**: O(rows × cols)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Simulate**: Place each character, track position
- **Inefficient**: O(rows × cols) time

### **Approach 3: String Concatenation**
- **Time**: O(rows + N)
- **Space**: O(N)
- **Concatenate**: Join sentence with spaces
- **Simulate**: Track pointer in concatenated string
- **Efficient**: But different approach

## Detailed Example Walkthrough

### **Example: `sentence = ["i","had","apple","pie"], rows = 4, cols = 5`**

```
Step 1: Precompute DP

Starting from word 0 ("i"):
  cur = 5, ptr = 0
  "i" fits: cur = 5 - 1 - 1 = 3, ptr = 1
  "had" fits: cur = 3 - 3 - 1 = -1 (doesn't fit, need 4)
  dp[0] = 0, next[0] = 1

Starting from word 1 ("had"):
  cur = 5, ptr = 1
  "had" fits: cur = 5 - 3 - 1 = 1, ptr = 2
  "apple" doesn't fit (need 5 + 1 = 6, but cur = 1)
  dp[1] = 0, next[1] = 2

Starting from word 2 ("apple"):
  cur = 5, ptr = 2
  "apple" fits: cur = 5 - 5 - 1 = -1 (doesn't fit, need 6)
  Actually, "apple" is 5 chars, need 5 + 1 = 6 for next word
  But we can fit just "apple" if it's the last word
  Let me recalculate: "apple" = 5 chars, fits in 5 cols
  But we need space after, so if cur = 5, we can fit "apple" but no space after
  Actually, the algorithm checks: cur >= sentence[ptr].size()
  So if cur = 5 and "apple".size() = 5, it fits
  Then cur = 5 - 5 - 1 = -1, which fails next check
  dp[2] = 0, next[2] = 3

Starting from word 3 ("pie"):
  cur = 5, ptr = 3
  "pie" fits: cur = 5 - 3 - 1 = 1, ptr = 0 (wrapped)
  count = 1
  "i" fits: cur = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 (doesn't fit)
  dp[3] = 1, next[3] = 0

dp = [0, 0, 0, 1]
next = [1, 2, 3, 0]

Step 2: Simulate rows

Row 0: cur = 0
  count += dp[0] = 0
  cur = next[0] = 1

Row 1: cur = 1
  count += dp[1] = 0
  cur = next[1] = 2

Row 2: cur = 2
  count += dp[2] = 0
  cur = next[2] = 3

Row 3: cur = 3
  count += dp[3] = 1
  cur = next[3] = 0

Total count = 1

Visual:
Row 0: i-had
Row 1: apple
Row 2: pie-i
Row 3: had--
```

## Edge Cases

1. **Single word**: Sentence with one word
2. **Long word**: Word longer than cols (can't fit)
3. **Exact fit**: Word exactly fits in one row
4. **Many rows**: Large number of rows
5. **Short sentence**: Sentence fits multiple times per row

## Optimization Notes

The algorithm efficiently handles:
- **Repeated patterns**: Same starting word always produces same result
- **Fast lookup**: O(1) per row instead of O(cols)
- **Memory efficient**: Only O(N) space for DP arrays
