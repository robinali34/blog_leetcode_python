# 207. Course Schedule

## Problem Statement

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- All the pairs `prerequisites[i]` are **unique**.

## Solution Approach

This problem is asking whether we can complete all courses given their prerequisites. This translates to checking if the **directed graph** formed by courses and prerequisites has **no cycles**.

### Key Insights:

1. **Graph representation**: Courses are nodes, prerequisites are directed edges
2. **Cycle detection**: If there's a cycle, we can't complete all courses
3. **Two approaches**: 
   - **Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm)**: Use indegree counting
   - **DFS Cycle Detection**: Use three-state coloring (white/gray/black)

### Algorithm:

#### **Approach 1: Topological Sort**
1. **Build graph**: Create adjacency list and calculate indegrees
2. **Find sources**: Start with courses having no prerequisites (indegree = 0)
3. **Process**: Remove sources and update indegrees of neighbors
4. **Check**: If all courses processed, no cycle exists

#### **Approach 2: DFS Cycle Detection**
1. **Three states**: 0=unvisited, 1=visiting, 2=visited
2. **DFS traversal**: Visit each unvisited node
3. **Cycle detection**: If we encounter a "visiting" node, cycle exists
4. **State update**: Mark as visiting during DFS, visited after completion

## Solution

### **Solution 1: Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm)**

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: list[list[int]]) -> bool:
        indegree = [0] * numCourses
        adj = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]

        for p in prerequisites:
            adj[p[1]].append(p[0])
            indegree[p[0]] += 1
        
        q = deque()
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if indegree[i] == 0:
                q.append(i)
        
        count = 0
        while q:
            course = q.popleft()
            count += 1
            for next_course in adj[course]:
                indegree[next_course] -= 1
                if indegree[next_course] == 0:
                    q.append(next_course)
        return count == numCourses
```

### **Solution 2: DFS Cycle Detection**

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: list[list[int]]) -> bool:
        adj = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        for p in prerequisites:
            adj[p[1]].append(p[0])
        # 0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited
        state = [0] * numCourses
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if self.hasCycle(i, adj, state):
                return False
        return True
    
    def hasCycle(self, node: int, adj: list[list[int]], state: list[int]) -> bool:
        if state[node] == 1:  # found a cycle
            return True
        if state[node] == 2:  # already visited, no cycle
            return False
        state[node] = 1  # mark as visiting
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if self.hasCycle(neighbor, adj, state):
                return True
        state[node] = 2  # mark as visited
        return False
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

#### **Topological Sort Approach:**
1. **Build graph**: Create adjacency list and calculate indegrees
2. **Initialize queue**: Add all courses with indegree 0 (no prerequisites)
3. **Process**: Remove course from queue, decrement indegrees of its neighbors
4. **Add to queue**: If neighbor's indegree becomes 0, add to queue
5. **Check completion**: If count equals numCourses, all courses can be completed

#### **DFS Cycle Detection Approach:**
1. **Three states**: 0=unvisited, 1=visiting, 2=visited
2. **DFS from each unvisited node**: Check for cycles
3. **Cycle detection**: If we encounter a "visiting" node during DFS, cycle exists
4. **State transitions**: unvisited → visiting → visited

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]`:**

```
Graph:
0 → 1 → 3
  ↘ 2 ↗

Topological Sort:
1. Indegrees: [0,1,1,2]
2. Start with course 0 (indegree=0)
3. Remove 0: indegrees become [0,0,0,2]
4. Add courses 1,2 to queue
5. Remove 1: indegrees become [0,0,0,1]
6. Remove 2: indegrees become [0,0,0,0]
7. Add course 3 to queue
8. Remove 3: count=4, return true

DFS Cycle Detection:
1. Start DFS from course 0
2. Visit 0: state[0]=1 (visiting)
3. Visit 1: state[1]=1 (visiting)
4. Visit 3: state[3]=1 (visiting)
5. No more neighbors, state[3]=2 (visited)
6. Back to 1: state[1]=2 (visited)
7. Back to 0: state[0]=2 (visited)
8. Continue with courses 2,3...
9. No cycles found, return true
```

## Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **V**: Number of courses (numCourses)
- **E**: Number of prerequisites
- **Graph building**: O(E)
- **Traversal**: O(V + E)
- **Total**: O(V + E)

### **Space Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **Adjacency list**: O(V + E)
- **Indegree array**: O(V)
- **Queue/Stack**: O(V)
- **State array**: O(V)
- **Total**: O(V + E)

## Key Points

1. **Graph problem**: Courses and prerequisites form a directed graph
2. **Cycle detection**: Cycle means impossible to complete all courses
3. **Two approaches**: Topological sort and DFS both work
4. **Topological sort**: More intuitive for this problem
5. **DFS**: More general approach for cycle detection

## Comparison: Topological Sort vs DFS

| Aspect | Topological Sort | DFS Cycle Detection |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Approach** | Indegree counting | Three-state coloring |
| **Intuition** | Process courses in order | Detect cycles directly |
| **Space** | Queue + Indegree array | Recursion stack + State array |
| **Code** | More straightforward | More elegant |
| **Performance** | Similar | Similar |

## Alternative Approaches

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: list[list[int]]) -> bool:
        adj = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        for p in prerequisites:
            adj[p[1]].append(p[0])
        
        state = [0] * numCourses  # 0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited
        stk = []
        
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if state[i] == 0:
                stk.append(i)
                while stk:
                    node = stk[-1]
                    if state[node] == 2:
                        stk.pop()
                        continue
                    if state[node] == 1:
                        return False  # cycle detected
                    
                    state[node] = 1  # visiting
                    for neighbor in adj[node]:
                        if state[neighbor] == 0:
                            stk.append(neighbor)
                        elif state[neighbor] == 1:
                            return False  # cycle detected
                    if stk and stk[-1] == node:
                        state[node] = 2  # visited
                        stk.pop()
        return True
```
