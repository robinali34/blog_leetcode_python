# 3110. Score of a String

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. The **score** of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

Return the **score** of `s`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "hello"
Output: 13

Explanation:
The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'h' = 104, 'e' = 101, 'l' = 108, 'l' = 108, 'o' = 111.
So, the score of s would be |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "zaz"
Output: 50

Explanation:
The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'z' = 122, 'a' = 97, 'z' = 122.
So, the score of s would be |122 - 97| + |97 - 122| = 25 + 25 = 50.
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Score calculation**: How is the score calculated? (Assumption: Sum of absolute differences between ASCII values of adjacent characters)

2. **Adjacent pairs**: Which pairs should we consider? (Assumption: All consecutive pairs - (s[0], s[1]), (s[1], s[2]), ..., (s[n-2], s[n-1]))

3. **Character set**: What characters can appear in the string? (Assumption: Only lowercase English letters 'a'-'z' - 26 characters)

4. **Empty string**: What should we return for an empty string? (Assumption: Based on constraints, length >= 2, so empty string not possible)

5. **Single character**: What if string has only one character? (Assumption: Based on constraints, length >= 2, so single character not possible)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)**

Iterate through the string, for each adjacent pair, calculate the absolute difference of their ASCII values and add to a running sum. This straightforward approach has O(n) time complexity, which is already optimal. However, we can consider if there's a more elegant implementation.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)**

Use a single loop with index i from 0 to n-2, calculate abs(s[i] - s[i+1]) for each pair. This is essentially the same as the brute-force but written more concisely. The time complexity remains O(n), which is optimal.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)**

Use a single pass: iterate through the string with index i from 0 to n-2, calculate the absolute difference between s[i] and s[i+1], and accumulate the sum. This achieves O(n) time with O(1) space, which is optimal. The problem is straightforward and doesn't require complex optimizations - the key is understanding that we need to process all adjacent pairs exactly once.

## Solution Approach

This is a straightforward **simulation** problem. We need to:
1. Iterate through all adjacent pairs of characters
2. Calculate the absolute difference between their ASCII values
3. Sum all the differences

### Key Insights:

1. **Adjacent Pairs**: Only consider consecutive characters `(s[i], s[i+1])`
2. **Absolute Difference**: Use `abs()` to get positive values
3. **ASCII Values**: Characters are automatically converted to integers in C++
4. **Single Pass**: Process the string in one iteration

### Algorithm:

1. Initialize `sum = 0`
2. Loop from `i = 0` to `i = s.length() - 2`
3. For each pair `(s[i], s[i+1])`:
   - Calculate `abs(s[i] - s[i+1])`
   - Add to `sum`
4. Return `sum`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
def scoreOfString(self, s):
    sum = 0
    for(i = 0 i < (int)s.length() - 1 i += 1) :
    sum += abs(s[i] - s[i + 1])
return sum
```

### Algorithm Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: `sum = 0` to accumulate the score
2. **Iteration**: Loop from `0` to `s.length() - 2` to access all adjacent pairs
   - Note: Cast `s.length()` to `int` to avoid unsigned integer issues
3. **Calculation**: For each adjacent pair:
   - `s[i] - s[i+1]` computes the difference in ASCII values
   - `abs()` ensures we get the absolute (positive) difference
   - Add to `sum`
4. **Return**: Return the total sum

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `s = "hello"`

```
i=0: |'h' - 'e'| = |104 - 101| = 3, sum = 3
i=1: |'e' - 'l'| = |101 - 108| = 7, sum = 10
i=2: |'l' - 'l'| = |108 - 108| = 0, sum = 10
i=3: |'l' - 'o'| = |108 - 111| = 3, sum = 13
Return: 13 ✓
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Single pass through the string
  - n = length of string
  - Each iteration does constant work
  - Overall: O(n)

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Only using a few variables (`sum`, `i`)
  - No additional data structures
  - Overall: O(1) extra space

## Key Insights

1. **Simple Simulation**: No complex algorithm needed, just iterate and sum
2. **ASCII Conversion**: Characters automatically convert to integers in C++
3. **Boundary Handling**: Loop from `0` to `length-2` to access all adjacent pairs
4. **Type Safety**: Cast `s.length()` to `int` to avoid unsigned comparison issues
5. **Absolute Value**: Always use `abs()` to ensure positive differences

## Edge Cases

1. **Minimum length (n=2)**: `s = "ab"` → `|97 - 98| = 1`
2. **Same characters**: `s = "aa"` → `|97 - 97| = 0`
3. **Maximum difference**: `s = "az"` → `|97 - 122| = 25`
4. **Repeated characters**: `s = "aaa"` → `0 + 0 = 0`
5. **Alternating**: `s = "abab"` → `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Off-by-one error**: Looping to `s.length()` instead of `s.length() - 1`
2. **Unsigned comparison**: Not casting `s.length()` to `int` can cause issues
3. **Forgetting absolute value**: Using `s[i] - s[i+1]` without `abs()`
4. **Empty string**: Not handling (though constraints guarantee `n >= 2`)
5. **Integer overflow**: Not an issue here since ASCII values are small (97-122)

## Alternative Approaches

### Using `std::accumulate` (C++)

```python
class Solution:
def scoreOfString(self, s):
    sum = 0
    for(i = 0 i < (int)s.length() - 1 i += 1) :
    sum += abs(s[i] - s[i + 1])
return sum
```

The provided solution is already optimal. Alternative approaches would be similar in complexity.
