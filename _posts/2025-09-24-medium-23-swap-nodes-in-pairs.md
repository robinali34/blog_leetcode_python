# [Medium] 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs

This is a classic linked list problem that requires understanding how to manipulate pointers and traverse linked lists. The key insight is understanding pointer manipulation, recursion, and iterative approaches with dummy nodes.

## Problem Description

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 100]
- 0 <= Node.val <= 100

## Template in Python

### ListNode definition

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```
Typical LeetCode template includes:

- Convert list[int] → ListNode (linked list)
- Convert ListNode → list[int]
- Clean, reusable design for testing LeetCode-style problems

## Approach

There are two main approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Recursive Approach**: Use recursion to swap pairs and handle the rest of the list
2. **Iterative Approach**: Use a dummy node and pointers to traverse and swap pairs

## Solution in Python

### Recursive Approach

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We visit each node once  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - Due to recursion stack

The recursive approach works by:
1. Base case: If we have 0 or 1 nodes, return the head
2. Swap the first two nodes
3. Recursively call the function on the rest of the list
4. Connect the swapped pair with the result from recursion
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        first = head
        second = head.next
        first.next = self.swapPairs(second.next)
        second.next = first
        return second
```

### Iterative Approach

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We visit each node once  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only using constant extra space

The iterative approach works by:
1. Create a dummy node to handle edge cases
2. Use a previous pointer to keep track of the last processed node
3. For each pair, swap the nodes and update pointers
4. Move to the next pair

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        pre = dummy
        while head and head.next:
            first = head
            second = head.next
            pre.next = second
            first.next = second.next
            second.next = first
            pre = first
            head = first.next
        return dummy.next
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's trace through the recursive solution with input `[1,2,3,4]`:

**Initial:** `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> null`

**Step 1:** Swap first pair (1,2)
- `first = 1`, `second = 2`
- `first->next = swapPairs(3)` (recursive call)
- `second->next = first`
- Result: `2 -> 1 -> [result of swapPairs(3)]`

**Step 2:** Recursive call with `3 -> 4 -> null`
- `first = 3`, `second = 4`
- `first->next = swapPairs(null)` (returns null)
- `second->next = first`
- Result: `4 -> 3 -> null`

**Final:** `2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> null`

## Key Insights

1. **Dummy Node**: The iterative approach uses a dummy node to simplify edge cases
2. **Pointer Manipulation**: Understanding how to update multiple pointers correctly
3. **Recursion vs Iteration**: Recursive is more elegant but uses O(n) space; iterative uses O(1) space
4. **Base Cases**: Always handle empty list and single node cases

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting to update the `pre` pointer in iterative approach
- Not handling the case where there's an odd number of nodes
- Incorrectly connecting pointers during the swap operation
