# [Medium] 75. Sort Colors

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Color representation**: What do 0, 1, 2 represent? (Assumption: 0 = red, 1 = white, 2 = blue - need to sort in this order)

2. **Sorting requirement**: What order should colors be in? (Assumption: All 0s first, then all 1s, then all 2s - ascending order)

3. **In-place requirement**: Should we sort in-place? (Assumption: Yes - modify array in-place, O(1) extra space)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Void - modify array in-place)

5. **Time complexity**: What time complexity is expected? (Assumption: O(n) - single pass using Dutch National Flag algorithm)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Count the frequency of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the array. Then overwrite the array: first write all 0s, then all 1s, then all 2s. This approach requires two passes: one to count and one to write. It works but doesn't achieve the optimal single-pass solution and uses O(1) extra space for counters.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use two pointers: one for the boundary between 0s and 1s, another for the boundary between 1s and 2s. Iterate through the array, swapping elements to place them in the correct region. However, managing three regions with two pointers can be tricky and error-prone. Need to be careful about the order of swaps and pointer movements.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use the Dutch National Flag algorithm with three pointers: `left` (end of 0s), `mid` (current element), and `right` (start of 2s). Maintain invariants: [0, left] contains 0s, [left+1, mid-1] contains 1s, [mid, right-1] is being processed, [right, n-1] contains 2s. If nums[mid] == 0, swap with left+1 and advance both. If nums[mid] == 1, advance mid. If nums[mid] == 2, swap with right-1 and decrement right. This achieves O(n) time with O(1) space in a single pass, which is optimal.

## Solution: Dutch National Flag Algorithm (Two Pointers)

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - Single pass through the array  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - In-place sorting with only constant extra space

The Dutch National Flag algorithm uses two pointers to partition the array into three regions:
- **Left region (0s)**: `[0, p0)`
- **Middle region (1s)**: `[p0, i)`
- **Right region (2s)**: `(p2, n-1]`

```python
class Solution:
def sortColors(self, nums):
    n = len(nums)
    p0 = 0, p2 = n - 1
    for(i = 0 i <= p2 i += 1) :
    while i <= p2  and  nums[i] == 2:
        swap(nums[i], nums[p2])
        p2 -= 1
    if nums[i] == 0:
        swap(nums[i], nums[p0])
        p0 += 1
```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Key Insight: Three-Way Partitioning

The algorithm maintains three regions:
1. **0s region**: All elements before `p0` are 0s
2. **1s region**: Elements between `p0` and `i` are 1s (or being processed)
3. **2s region**: All elements after `p2` are 2s

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize pointers**:
   - `p0 = 0`: Next position to place a 0
   - `p2 = n - 1`: Next position to place a 2
   - `i = 0`: Current element being processed

2. **Process each element**:
   - If `nums[i] == 2`: Swap with `nums[p2]` and decrement `p2` (use `while` to handle swapped 2s)
   - If `nums[i] == 0`: Swap with `nums[p0]` and increment `p0`
   - If `nums[i] == 1`: Leave it (it's in the correct region), increment `i`

3. **Termination**: When `i > p2`, all elements are processed

### Why the `while` Loop for 2s?

When we swap `nums[i]` with `nums[p2]`, the element at `p2` might be a 2. We need to keep swapping until `nums[i]` is not 2, otherwise we might leave a 2 in the wrong position.

### Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]`

```
Initial: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
         i=0              p2=5, p0=0

i=0: nums[0]=2, swap with nums[5]=0
     [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2]
     i=0              p2=4, p0=0
     nums[0]=0, swap with nums[0] (no change), p0=1

i=1: nums[1]=0, swap with nums[1] (no change), p0=2

i=2: nums[2]=2, swap with nums[4]=1
     [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
     i=2          p2=3, p0=2
     nums[2]=1, leave it

i=3: nums[3]=1, leave it
     i=3 > p2=3, done

Result: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2] ✓
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Single pass | O(n) | O(1) |
| Swaps | O(n) worst case | - |
| **Overall** | **O(n)** | **O(1)** |

## Key Points

1. **In-place sorting**: No extra space needed (except for variables)
2. **Single pass**: Each element is visited at most twice
3. **Two pointers**: `p0` for 0s, `p2` for 2s
4. **While loop for 2s**: Ensures swapped 2s are handled correctly
5. **Order matters**: Handle 2s first (with while), then 0s

## Edge Cases

1. **All same color**: `[0,0,0]`, `[1,1,1]`, `[2,2,2]`
2. **Already sorted**: `[0,1,2]`
3. **Reverse sorted**: `[2,1,0]`
4. **Single element**: `[1]`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not using `while` for 2s**: If you use `if`, swapped 2s might be left in wrong position
2. **Wrong loop condition**: Must use `i <= p2`, not `i < n`
3. **Incrementing `i` after swapping 0**: After swapping with `p0`, we should increment `i` (which happens naturally in the for loop)
4. **Not handling swapped 2s**: The `while` loop is crucial for correctness

## Alternative Approach: Counting Sort

For this specific problem (only 3 values), we could use counting sort:

```python
class Solution:
def sortColors(self, nums):
    count[3] = :0
for(num : nums) count[num]++
idx = 0
for(color = 0 color < 3 color += 1) :
while count[color]-- > 0:
    nums[idx += 1] = color
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only 3 counters

However, the two-pointer approach is more general and can be extended to partition problems.

## Follow-up: Minimize Swaps While Moving 0s to Front and 2s to End

**Problem Variant:** What if we only need to ensure 0s are in front, and during swaps, we want to minimize the number of swaps while moving as many 2s to the end as possible?

### Solution: Two-Pass Approach

The key insight is to process in the optimal order:
1. **First pass**: Move all 2s to the end (maximizes 2s at end)
2. **Second pass**: Move all 0s to the front (ensures 0s in front)

This minimizes swaps because:
- Moving 2s first doesn't interfere with 0s
- Moving 0s after ensures they go to the front without disrupting 2s

```python
class Solution:
def sortColorsMinSwaps(self, nums):
    n = len(nums)
    p0 = 0, p2 = n - 1
    // First pass: Move all 2s to the end
    while p0 <= p2:
        if nums[p2] == 2:
            p2 -= 1
             else if(nums[p0] == 2) :
            swap(nums[p0], nums[p2])
            p2 -= 1
             else :
            p0 += 1
    // Second pass: Move all 0s to the front
    p0 = 0
    for(i = 0 i <= p2 i += 1) :
    if nums[i] == 0:
        swap(nums[i], nums[p0])
        p0 += 1
```

### Alternative: Single-Pass Greedy Approach

We can also do this in a single pass by being more strategic about swaps:

```python
class Solution:
def sortColorsMinSwaps(self, nums):
    n = len(nums)
    left = 0, right = n - 1
    i = 0
    while i <= right:
        if nums[i] == 0:
            // Move 0 to front
            swap(nums[i], nums[left])
            left += 1
            i += 1
             else if(nums[i] == 2) :
            // Move 2 to end, but don't increment i
            // because swapped element needs to be checked
            swap(nums[i], nums[right])
            right -= 1
             else :
            // nums[i] == 1, leave it
            i += 1
```

### Why This Minimizes Swaps?

1. **Prioritize 2s**: By moving 2s to the end first, we avoid moving them multiple times
2. **Avoid redundant swaps**: Once a 2 is at the end, we don't touch it again
3. **0s naturally go to front**: After 2s are moved, 0s can be placed at the front without interference

### Example: Minimizing Swaps

**Input:** `nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]`

**Two-pass approach:**
```
Initial: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]

Pass 1 (Move 2s to end):
[2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0] -> swap(0,5): [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2]
[0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2] -> swap(2,4): [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Total swaps: 2

Pass 2 (Move 0s to front):
[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2] -> already in place
Total swaps: 0

Final: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Total swaps: 2
```

**Original approach (for comparison):**
```
[2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0] -> swap(0,5): [0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2] (swap 1)
[0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2] -> swap(2,4): [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2] (swap 2)
Total swaps: 2
```

In this case, both approaches have the same number of swaps, but the two-pass approach is more predictable and easier to reason about.

### Example 2: Some 2s Remain in Middle (Swap Minimization)

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,0,2,1,0]`

**Two-pass approach (minimize swaps):**
```
Initial: [1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0]

Pass 1 (Move 2s to end):
[1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0] -> p2=5 is 0, p0=0 is 1, move p0
[1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0] -> p0=1 is 2, swap(1,5): [1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2]
[1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2] -> p2=4 is 1, p0=1 is 0, move p0
[1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2] -> p0=2 is 0, move p0
[1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2] -> p0=3 is 2, swap(3,4): [1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2]
Total swaps: 2

Pass 2 (Move 0s to front):
[1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2] -> swap(0,1): [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2]
[0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2] -> swap(1,2): [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Total swaps: 2

Final: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Total swaps: 4
```

**Note:** In this case, we successfully moved all 2s to the end. But consider a variant where we want to minimize swaps even if it means some 2s stay in the middle.

### Example 3: Constrained Scenario - Some 2s Stay in Middle

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,0,2,1,0,2,1]`

**Scenario:** If we want to minimize swaps and 0s are the priority, we might accept some 2s in the middle.

**Approach 1: Prioritize 0s first (minimize swaps)**
```
Initial: [1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1]

Move 0s to front:
[1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1] -> swap(0,2): [0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1]
[0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1] -> swap(1,5): [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]
Swaps: 2

Result: [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]
- 0s in front: ✓
- Some 2s in middle: positions 3, 5, 6
- Total swaps: 2 (minimized)
```

**Approach 2: Move all 2s to end (more swaps)**
```
Initial: [1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1]

Pass 1: Move 2s to end
[1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1] -> swap(1,7): [1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2]
[1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2] -> swap(3,6): [1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2]
Wait, position 6 is already 2. Let me recalculate:
After first swap: [1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2], p2=6
p0=0 is 1, move p0
p0=1 is 1, move p0  
p0=2 is 0, move p0
p0=3 is 2, swap(3,6): [1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2] (no change, both 2)
Actually: [1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2] -> swap(3,5): [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]
Swaps: 2

Pass 2: Move 0s to front
[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2] -> swap(0,2): [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]
[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2] -> swap(1,3): [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
Swaps: 2

Final: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
Total swaps: 4
```

**Comparison:**
- Approach 1: 2 swaps, but 2s remain scattered → `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]`
- Approach 2: 4 swaps, all 2s at end → `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`

If minimizing swaps is the priority, Approach 1 is better, even though some 2s remain in the middle.

### Example 4: Many 2s, Few 0s - Minimal Swaps

**Input:** `nums = [2,2,2,0,2,2,2]`

**Two-pass approach:**
```
Initial: [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]

Pass 1 (Move 2s to end):
Since most positions are already 2s, we just need to move the 0:
[2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2] -> swap(0,3): [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Swaps: 1

Pass 2 (Move 0s to front):
[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] -> already in place
Swaps: 0

Final: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Total swaps: 1
```

**Key observation:** With only 1 swap, we achieved:
- 0s in front: ✓
- Most 2s at end: ✓ (all except position 1, which is still in the 2s region)
- Minimal swaps: ✓

### Example 5: 2s Scattered, Minimize Swaps

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,1,0,2,1,0,2]`

**Two-pass approach:**
```
Initial: [1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2]

Pass 1 (Move 2s to end):
[1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2] -> p2=7 is 2, skip
[1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2] -> p2=6 is 0, p0=0 is 1, move p0
[1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2] -> p0=1 is 2, swap(1,6): [1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2]
[1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2] -> p2=5 is 1, p0=2 is 1, move p0
[1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2] -> p0=3 is 0, move p0
[1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 2] -> p0=4 is 2, swap(4,5): [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]
Swaps: 2

Pass 2 (Move 0s to front):
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2] -> swap(0,1): [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]
[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2] -> swap(1,3): [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
Swaps: 2

Final: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
Total swaps: 4
```

**If we prioritize 0s first (alternative):**
```
[1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2] -> swap(0,3): [0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2]
[0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2] -> swap(1,6): [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2]
Now move 2s: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2] -> swap(4,6): [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
Total swaps: 3 (better!)
```

This shows that sometimes prioritizing 0s first can result in fewer total swaps, depending on the distribution.

### Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space | Swaps |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Two-pass | O(n) | O(1) | Minimized |
| Single-pass | O(n) | O(1) | Minimized |
| Original | O(n) | O(1) | May be suboptimal |

### Key Differences from Original

1. **Order of operations**: Process 2s first, then 0s
2. **Swap minimization**: Avoids redundant swaps
3. **Goal**: Ensure 0s in front + maximize 2s at end (1s can be anywhere in middle)
