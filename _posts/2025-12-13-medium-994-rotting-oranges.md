# [Medium] 994. Rotting Oranges

You are given an `m x n` grid where each cell can have one of three values:

- `0` representing an empty cell,
- `1` representing a fresh orange, or
- `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return *the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange*. If this is impossible, return `-1`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
```

## Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Cell types**: What do the values represent? (Assumption: 0 = empty cell, 1 = fresh orange, 2 = rotten orange)

2. **Rotting process**: How do oranges rot? (Assumption: Rotten oranges rot adjacent fresh oranges (up, down, left, right) each minute)

3. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - minimum minutes until no fresh oranges remain, or -1 if impossible)

4. **All rotten**: What if all oranges are already rotten? (Assumption: Return 0 - no time needed)

5. **No fresh oranges**: What if there are no fresh oranges? (Assumption: Return 0 - nothing to rot)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Simulate minute by minute: for each minute, find all fresh oranges adjacent to rotten oranges and mark them as rotten. Repeat until no more fresh oranges can rot. Count the number of minutes. This approach works but requires scanning the entire grid each minute, giving O(m × n × minutes) complexity, which can be inefficient if many minutes are needed.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use BFS starting from all rotten oranges simultaneously (multi-source BFS). Add all rotten oranges to the queue initially. Process level by level, where each level represents one minute. For each level, process all oranges, rot adjacent fresh oranges, and add them to the next level. This reduces redundant scanning but still requires careful level tracking.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use multi-source BFS with a level marker (sentinel value or separate level tracking). Initialize queue with all rotten oranges. Use a sentinel value (like -1) to mark level boundaries, or process level-by-level by tracking queue size before processing. For each level, process all nodes, rot adjacent fresh oranges, and add them to the queue. Track minutes as levels. After BFS completes, check if any fresh oranges remain (return -1) or return the number of minutes. This achieves O(m × n) time complexity, visiting each cell at most once, which is optimal.

## Solution 1: Multi-Source BFS with Level Marker (Recommended)

**Time Complexity:** O(m × n) - Each cell is visited at most once  
**Space Complexity:** O(m × n) - For the queue

This solution uses BFS starting from all rotten oranges simultaneously. A special marker `{-1, -1}` is used to separate levels (minutes).

```python
class Solution:
def orangesRotting(self, grid):
    deque[pair<int, int>> cache
    freshOranges = 0
    ROWS = len(grid), COLS = grid[0].__len__()
    // Find all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges
    for (r = 0 r < ROWS r += 1) :
    for (c = 0 c < COLS c += 1) :
    if grid[r][c] == 2:
        cache.push(:r, c)
         else if(grid[r][c] == 1) :
        freshOranges += 1
// Add level separator
cache.push(:-1, -1)
minutesElapsed = -1
dirs[4][2] = ::-1, 0, :1, 0, :0, 1, :0, -1
while not not cache:
    [row, col] = cache[0]
    cache.pop()
    if row == -1:
        // Level separator encountered
        minutesElapsed += 1
        if not not cache:
            // Add separator for next level
            cache.push(:-1, -1)
         else :
        // Process current rotten orange
        for d in dirs:
            nr = row + d[0]
            nc = col + d[1]
            if nr >= 0  and  nr < ROWS  and  nc >= 0  and  nc < COLS  and  grid[nr][nc] == 1:
                grid[nr][nc] = 2  // Mark as rotten
                freshOranges -= 1
                cache.push(:nr, nc)
(minutesElapsed if         return freshOranges == 0  else -1)
```

### How Solution 1 Works

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Find all rotten oranges (value 2) and add them to queue
   - Count all fresh oranges (value 1)
   - Add level separator `{-1, -1}` after initial rotten oranges

2. **BFS Processing**:
   - When encountering `{-1, -1}`, increment minutes and add separator for next level
   - For each rotten orange, check 4 neighbors
   - If neighbor is fresh, mark it as rotten, decrement fresh count, and add to queue

3. **Result**: 
   - If all fresh oranges are rotten (`freshOranges == 0`), return minutes elapsed
   - Otherwise, return -1 (impossible to rot all oranges)

### Key Insight

The `{-1, -1}` marker acts as a level separator:
- All oranges at the same level (same minute) are processed together
- When we encounter the marker, we know we've finished one minute
- This allows us to track time without maintaining a separate distance/time array

## Solution 2: Multi-Source BFS with Level-by-Level Processing

**Time Complexity:** O(m × n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(m × n)

This approach processes each level explicitly by tracking queue size.

```python
class Solution:
def orangesRotting(self, grid):
    deque[pair<int, int>> q
    freshOranges = 0
    ROWS = len(grid), COLS = grid[0].__len__()
    dirs[4][2] = ::-1, 0, :1, 0, :0, 1, :0, -1
// Find all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges
for (r = 0 r < ROWS r += 1) :
for (c = 0 c < COLS c += 1) :
if grid[r][c] == 2:
    q.push(:r, c)
     else if(grid[r][c] == 1) :
    freshOranges += 1
minutes = 0
while not not q  and  freshOranges > 0:
    levelSize = len(q)
    for(i = 0 i < levelSize i += 1) :
    [row, col] = q[0]
    q.pop()
    for d in dirs:
        nr = row + d[0]
        nc = col + d[1]
        if nr >= 0  and  nr < ROWS  and  nc >= 0  and  nc < COLS  and  grid[nr][nc] == 1:
            grid[nr][nc] = 2
            freshOranges -= 1
            q.push(:nr, nc)
if(freshOranges > 0) minutes += 1
(minutes if         return freshOranges == 0  else -1)
```

### How Solution 2 Works

1. **Level-by-level processing**: Process all nodes at current level before moving to next
2. **Queue size tracking**: `levelSize = q.size()` captures all nodes at current minute
3. **Increment minutes**: Only increment after processing a level (if fresh oranges remain)

## Solution 3: BFS with Distance Array

**Time Complexity:** O(m × n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(m × n)

This approach maintains a separate distance/time array to track when each orange rots.

```python
class Solution:
def orangesRotting(self, grid):
    ROWS = len(grid), COLS = grid[0].__len__()
    deque[pair<int, int>> q
    list[list[int>> time(ROWS, list[int>(COLS, -1))
    freshOranges = 0
    dirs[4][2] = ::-1, 0, :1, 0, :0, 1, :0, -1
// Initialize: add rotten oranges to queue
for (r = 0 r < ROWS r += 1) :
for (c = 0 c < COLS c += 1) :
if grid[r][c] == 2:
    q.push(:r, c)
    time[r][c] = 0
     else if(grid[r][c] == 1) :
    freshOranges += 1
maxTime = 0
while not not q:
    [row, col] = q[0]
    q.pop()
    for d in dirs:
        nr = row + d[0]
        nc = col + d[1]
        if(nr >= 0  and  nr < ROWS  and  nc >= 0  and  nc < COLS  and
        grid[nr][nc] == 1  and  time[nr][nc] == -1) :
        time[nr][nc] = time[row][col] + 1
        maxTime = max(maxTime, time[nr][nc])
        grid[nr][nc] = 2
        freshOranges -= 1
        q.push(:nr, nc)
(maxTime if         return freshOranges == 0  else -1)
```

### How Solution 3 Works

1. **Distance array**: `time[r][c]` stores when orange at `(r, c)` becomes rotten
2. **Track maximum time**: Keep track of maximum time needed
3. **Visited check**: Use `time[nr][nc] == -1` to check if not yet processed

## Comparison of Approaches

| Aspect | Solution 1 (Marker) | Solution 2 (Level Size) | Solution 3 (Distance) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(m×n) | O(m×n) | O(m×n) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(m×n) | O(m×n) | O(m×n) |
| **Extra Space** | None | None | Distance array |
| **Code Clarity** | Good | Excellent | Good |
| **Level Tracking** | Marker-based | Size-based | Distance-based |

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]`

### Solution 1 (Marker-based):
```
Initial:
  Rotten: (0,0)
  Fresh: 5 oranges
  Queue: [(0,0), (-1,-1)]

Minute 0:
  Process (0,0): Rot (0,1) and (1,0)
  Queue: [(-1,-1), (0,1), (1,0)]
  Fresh: 3

Minute 1:
  Process (0,1): Rot (0,2)
  Process (1,0): Rot (1,1)
  Queue: [(-1,-1), (0,2), (1,1)]
  Fresh: 1

Minute 2:
  Process (0,2): No new rots
  Process (1,1): Rot (2,1)
  Queue: [(-1,-1), (2,1)]
  Fresh: 0

Minute 3:
  Process (2,1): Rot (2,2)
  Queue: [(-1,-1), (2,2)]
  Fresh: 0

Minute 4:
  Process (2,2): No new rots
  Queue: [(-1,-1)]
  Fresh: 0

Result: 4 minutes
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Initial scan | O(m×n) | O(1) |
| BFS traversal | O(m×n) | O(m×n) |
| **Overall** | **O(m×n)** | **O(m×n)** |

## Edge Cases

1. **No fresh oranges**: `[[0,2]]` → return 0
2. **Impossible to rot all**: Isolated fresh orange → return -1
3. **All rotten initially**: `[[2,2]]` → return 0
4. **All fresh initially**: No rotten oranges → return -1
5. **Empty grid**: Not possible per constraints

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not counting initial fresh oranges**: Must count before BFS starts
2. **Wrong level tracking**: Forgetting to increment minutes at right time
3. **Boundary checks**: Not checking array bounds before accessing
4. **Visited tracking**: Not marking as rotten immediately (could process same cell twice)
5. **Return value**: Returning minutes when freshOranges > 0 (should return -1)

## Key Insights

1. **Multi-source BFS**: Start from all rotten oranges simultaneously
2. **Level separation**: Need to track time/levels to know when all oranges at current level are processed
3. **Fresh count tracking**: Decrement count when rotting, check if zero at end
4. **Grid modification**: Mark as rotten immediately to avoid reprocessing

## Optimization Tips

1. **Early termination**: Can break early if `freshOranges == 0` during BFS
2. **Space optimization**: Solution 1 uses no extra space beyond queue
3. **Level tracking**: Marker approach is elegant but level-size approach is clearer
