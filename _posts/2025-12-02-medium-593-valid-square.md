# [Medium] 593. Valid Square

Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`, return `true` if the four points construct a square.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,12]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: p1 = [1,0], p2 = [-1,0], p3 = [0,1], p4 = [0,-1]
Output: true
```

## Constraints

- `p1.length == p2.length == p3.length == p4.length == 2`
- `-10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Square definition**: What makes a valid square? (Assumption: Four points forming a square - four equal sides, four right angles, two equal diagonals)

2. **Point order**: Are points given in any specific order? (Assumption: No - points can be in any order, need to determine if they form a square)

3. **Degenerate cases**: Can points be collinear or form other shapes? (Assumption: Need to check - points might form rectangle, rhombus, or other shapes)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Boolean - true if points form a valid square, false otherwise)

5. **Duplicate points**: Can there be duplicate points? (Assumption: Per problem, should check - duplicate points cannot form a square)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to check if points form square. Let me try all possible orderings."

**Naive Solution**: Try all possible ways to order 4 points, check if they form square by verifying sides and angles.

**Complexity**: O(4!) = O(24) time, O(1) space

**Issues**:
- Checks many invalid orderings
- Complex geometric calculations
- Doesn't leverage distance properties
- Can be optimized

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "Square has specific distance properties: 4 equal sides, 2 equal diagonals."

**Improved Solution**: Calculate all 6 pairwise distances. Square should have: 4 equal side lengths, 2 equal diagonal lengths, sides != diagonals.

**Complexity**: O(1) time, O(1) space

**Improvements**:
- Leverages distance properties
- O(1) time - constant time check
- Handles all geometric cases
- Clean and efficient

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Distance-based validation is optimal. Check for exactly 2 unique distances (sides and diagonals)."

**Best Solution**: Calculate all pairwise distances. Valid square has exactly 2 unique distances: 4 sides (equal) and 2 diagonals (equal), with diagonal > side.

**Complexity**: O(1) time, O(1) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Distance properties are key insight
2. O(1) time is optimal - fixed 4 points
3. Check for exactly 2 unique distances
4. Handle edge cases (collinear points, etc.)

## Solution: Distance-Based Validation

**Time Complexity:** O(1) - Constant time since we only have 4 points  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Using a set with at most 2 elements

The key insight is that a valid square has exactly **two unique distances**:
1. **Side length** (appears 4 times - 4 sides)
2. **Diagonal length** (appears 2 times - 2 diagonals)

Additionally, we must check that no two points are the same (distance = 0).

```python
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
class Solution:
def validSquare(self, p1, p2, p3, p4):
    set[int> distances
    list[list[int>> points = :p1, p2, p3, p4
for(i = 0 i < 4 i += 1) :
for(j = i + 1 j < 4 j += 1) :
dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0]
dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1]
distSq = dx  dx + dy  dy
if(distSq == 0) return False # Duplicate points
distances.insert(distSq)
return len(distances) == 2

```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Key Insight: Square Properties

A square has specific distance properties:
- **4 equal sides**: Each side has the same length
- **2 equal diagonals**: Each diagonal has the same length
- **Diagonal = side × √2**: By Pythagorean theorem

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Calculate all pairwise distances**: For 4 points, there are C(4,2) = 6 pairs
2. **Check for duplicate points**: If any distance is 0, return false
3. **Count unique distances**: A valid square has exactly 2 unique distances
   - One distance appears 4 times (sides)
   - Another distance appears 2 times (diagonals)

### Why This Works

For a valid square with 4 points:
- **6 total distances**: 4 sides + 2 diagonals
- **2 unique distances**: side² and diagonal²
- **No zero distances**: All points are distinct

The condition `distances.size() == 2` ensures:
- All 4 sides are equal (same distance appears 4 times)
- Both diagonals are equal (same distance appears 2 times)
- The shape is a square (not a rectangle, which would have different side lengths)

### Example Walkthrough

**Example 1:** `p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]`

```
Distances:
- p1-p2: (0-1)² + (0-1)² = 1 + 1 = 2 (diagonal)
- p1-p3: (0-1)² + (0-0)² = 1 + 0 = 1 (side)
- p1-p4: (0-0)² + (0-1)² = 0 + 1 = 1 (side)
- p2-p3: (1-1)² + (1-0)² = 0 + 1 = 1 (side)
- p2-p4: (1-0)² + (1-1)² = 1 + 0 = 1 (side)
- p3-p4: (1-0)² + (0-1)² = 1 + 1 = 2 (diagonal)

Unique distances: {1, 2}
Size: 2 ✓ (valid square)
```

**Example 2:** `p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,12]`

```
Distances:
- p1-p2: 2
- p1-p3: 1
- p1-p4: 144
- p2-p3: 1
- p2-p4: 122
- p3-p4: 145

Unique distances: {1, 2, 122, 144, 145}
Size: 5 ✗ (not a square)
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Calculate distances | O(1) | O(1) |
| Store in set | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Overall** | **O(1)** | **O(1)** |

## Edge Cases

1. **Duplicate points**: If any two points are the same, return false
2. **Rectangle**: Would have 3 unique distances (2 different sides + 1 diagonal)
3. **Rhombus**: Would have 2 unique distances but diagonal ≠ side × √2 (but our solution still works)
4. **Degenerate cases**: All points collinear or forming other shapes

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not checking for duplicate points**: Must return false if `distSq == 0`
2. **Wrong distance count**: Expecting exactly 2 unique distances, not more or less
3. **Using floating point**: Using squared distances avoids precision issues
4. **Not considering all pairs**: Must check all 6 pairs of points

## Alternative Approach: Verify Diagonal Relationship

A more rigorous approach would also verify that `diagonal² = 2 × side²`:

```python
class Solution:
def validSquare(self, p1, p2, p3, p4):
    dict[int, int> distCount
    list[list[int>> points = :p1, p2, p3, p4
for(i = 0 i < 4 i += 1) :
for(j = i + 1 j < 4 j += 1) :
dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0]
dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1]
distSq = dx  dx + dy  dy
if(distSq == 0) return False
distCount[distSq]++
if(len(distCount) != 2) return False
side = 0, diagonal = 0
for([dist, count] : distCount) :
if(count == 4) side = dist
else if(count == 2) diagonal = dist
else return False
return diagonal == 2  side # Verify diagonal² = 2 × side²

```

However, the simpler solution (checking `distances.size() == 2`) is sufficient because:
- If there are exactly 2 unique distances with 4 points
- And one appears 4 times (sides) and one appears 2 times (diagonals)
- Then it must be a square (the geometric constraints are satisfied)
