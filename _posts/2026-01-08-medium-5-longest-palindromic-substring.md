# [Medium] 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return *the longest **palindromic substring** in* `s`.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: "a"
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consist of only digits and English letters.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Palindrome definition**: What makes a string a palindrome? (Assumption: Reads the same forwards and backwards - symmetric string)

2. **Substring vs subsequence**: Do we need a contiguous substring or can it be a subsequence? (Assumption: Substring - must be contiguous characters from the original string)

3. **Multiple palindromes**: What if there are multiple palindromes of the same maximum length? (Assumption: Return any one of them - typically the first one found)

4. **Case sensitivity**: Are character comparisons case-sensitive? (Assumption: Yes - 'A' and 'a' are different characters)

5. **Single character**: Is a single character considered a palindrome? (Assumption: Yes - single character is a palindrome of length 1)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Check all possible substrings to see if they are palindromes. For each starting position i and ending position j, check if s[i:j+1] is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends. Keep track of the longest palindrome found. This approach has O(n³) time complexity (O(n²) substrings × O(n) palindrome check), which is too slow for strings up to 1000 characters.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming: dp[i][j] = true if substring s[i:j+1] is a palindrome. Fill the DP table: base case is single characters and pairs, then for longer substrings, check if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i+1][j-1] is true. This reduces palindrome checking to O(1) per substring, giving O(n²) time complexity with O(n²) space. This works but can be optimized further.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use the "expand around center" approach: for each possible center (character or gap between characters), expand outward while characters match. There are 2n-1 centers (n characters + n-1 gaps). For each center, expand and track the longest palindrome. This achieves O(n²) time with O(1) space. Alternatively, use Manacher's algorithm for O(n) time, but it's more complex. The expand-around-center approach is simpler and sufficient for most cases, providing a good balance between complexity and performance.

## Solution Approaches

There are several approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Expand Around Center**: For each position, expand outward to find palindromes (O(n²) time, O(1) space)
2. **Manacher's Algorithm**: Linear time algorithm using preprocessing (O(n) time, O(n) space)
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Build a DP table to track palindromes (O(n²) time, O(n²) space)

### Approach 1: Expand Around Center (Recommended for Interviews)

**Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

The key insight is that every palindrome expands from a center. For each position, we check:
- **Odd-length palindromes**: Center at a single character (e.g., "aba" centered at 'b')
- **Even-length palindromes**: Center between two characters (e.g., "abba" centered between two 'b's)

### Approach 2: Manacher's Algorithm (Optimal)

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Uses preprocessing to transform the string and then uses symmetry properties to avoid redundant checks.

## Solution 1: Expand Around Center

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        if n < 2:
            return s

        start = 0
        maxLen = 1

        for i in range(n):
            self.expandAroundCenter(s, i, i, start, maxLen)
            self.expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1, start, maxLen)

        return s[start:start + maxLen]

    def expandAroundCenter(self, s, left, right, start, maxLen):
        n = len(s)

        while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:
            length = right - left + 1

            if length > maxLen:
                # update via list trick (since ints are immutable in Python)
                start = left
                maxLen = length

            left -= 1
            right += 1
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Initialize (Lines 4-6)**:
   - Handle edge case: if string length < 2, return the string itself
   - Initialize `start = 0` and `maxLen = 1` to track the longest palindrome found

2. **For Each Position (Lines 7-10)**:
   - **Check odd-length palindromes**: Expand from `(i, i)` - center at single character
   - **Check even-length palindromes**: Expand from `(i, i+1)` - center between two characters

3. **Expand Function (Lines 13-22)**:
   - **Expand outward**: While characters match and within bounds, expand `left--` and `right++`
   - **Update maximum**: If current palindrome length > `maxLen`, update `start` and `maxLen`
   - **Stop when mismatch**: Stop expanding when characters don't match or out of bounds

### **Why This Works:**

- **Two types of centers**: Handles both odd and even length palindromes
- **Greedy expansion**: For each center, expands as far as possible
- **Optimal tracking**: Updates the longest palindrome found so far

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `s = "babad"`:**

```
Initial: start = 0, maxLen = 1

i = 0: Check "b"
  - Odd: expandAroundCenter(0, 0) → "b" (len=1, no update)
  - Even: expandAroundCenter(0, 1) → "ba" (no match, stop)
  
i = 1: Check "a"
  - Odd: expandAroundCenter(1, 1) → "a" → "bab" (len=3, update: start=0, maxLen=3)
  - Even: expandAroundCenter(1, 2) → "ab" (no match, stop)
  
i = 2: Check "b"
  - Odd: expandAroundCenter(2, 2) → "b" → "aba" (len=3, no update, same length)
  - Even: expandAroundCenter(2, 3) → "ba" (no match, stop)
  
i = 3: Check "a"
  - Odd: expandAroundCenter(3, 3) → "a" (len=1, no update)
  - Even: expandAroundCenter(3, 4) → "ad" (no match, stop)
  
i = 4: Check "d"
  - Odd: expandAroundCenter(4, 4) → "d" (len=1, no update)
  - Even: expandAroundCenter(4, 5) → out of bounds

Result: s.substr(0, 3) = "bab"
```

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n²)
  - For each of n positions, we expand outward
  - In worst case, expansion can go up to n/2 in each direction
  - Total: O(n × n) = O(n²)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Only using a few variables: `start`, `maxLen`, `left`, `right`

## Solution 2: Manacher's Algorithm

```python
class Solution:
    def preprocess(self, s):
        t = "^"
        for c in s:
            t += "#" + c
        t += "#$"
        return t

    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        if not s:
            return ""

        t = self.preprocess(s)
        n = len(t)

        p = [0] * n

        center = 0
        right = 0

        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            mirror = 2 * center - i

            if i < right:
                p[i] = min(right - i, p[mirror])

            # expand around center
            while t[i + p[i] + 1] == t[i - p[i] - 1]:
                p[i] += 1

            # update center and right
            if i + p[i] > right:
                center = i
                right = i + p[i]

        maxLen = 0
        centerIndex = 0

        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if p[i] > maxLen:
                maxLen = p[i]
                centerIndex = i

        start = (centerIndex - maxLen) // 2

        return s[start:start + maxLen]
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Preprocessing (Lines 3-11)**:
   - Transform string by inserting `#` between characters
   - Add sentinels `^` at start and `$` at end
   - Example: `"aba"` → `"^#a#b#a#$"`
   - **Why?** This converts all palindromes to odd-length, simplifying the algorithm

2. **Main Algorithm (Lines 17-33)**:
   - `p[i]`: Length of palindrome centered at position `i` in transformed string
   - `center`: Center of the rightmost palindrome found so far
   - `right`: Right boundary of the palindrome centered at `center`
   - **For each position `i`**:
     - **Mirror symmetry**: If `i` is within current palindrome, use mirror position to initialize `p[i]`
     - **Expand**: Try to expand palindrome centered at `i`
     - **Update**: If palindrome extends beyond `right`, update `center` and `right`

3. **Find Longest (Lines 35-42)**:
   - Find the maximum value in `p` array
   - Convert back to original string indices

### **Key Insight: Mirror Symmetry**

If we know a palindrome centered at `center` extends to `right`, and `i` is within this palindrome, then:
- The palindrome centered at `i` will be at least as long as the palindrome at its mirror position `mirror = 2*center - i`
- This avoids redundant checks, making it O(n)

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `s = "babad"`:**

```
Step 1: Preprocess
t = "^#b#a#b#a#d#$"

Step 2: Build p array
i=1: p[1]=0, center=1, right=1
i=2: p[2]=1 (palindrome "#b#"), center=2, right=3
i=3: p[3]=0, center=2, right=3
i=4: p[4]=3 (palindrome "#b#a#b#"), center=4, right=7
i=5: p[5]=0, center=4, right=7
i=6: p[6]=1 (palindrome "#a#b#"), center=6, right=7
i=7: p[7]=0, center=4, right=7
i=8: p[8]=0, center=4, right=7
i=9: p[9]=0, center=4, right=7

Step 3: Find maximum
maxLen = 3, centerIndex = 4
start = (4 - 3) / 2 = 0
Result: s.substr(0, 3) = "bab"
```

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Each character is processed at most once
  - The `right` boundary only moves forward
  - Total: O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - O(n) for transformed string `t`
  - O(n) for `p` array

## Comparison of Approaches

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Expand Around Center | O(n²) | O(1) | Simple, intuitive, good for interviews |
| Manacher's Algorithm | O(n) | O(n) | Optimal, but more complex |
| Dynamic Programming | O(n²) | O(n²) | Straightforward but uses more space |

## Key Insights

1. **Two Types of Centers**: Odd-length (single char) and even-length (between chars)
2. **Expand Greedily**: For each center, expand as far as possible
3. **Manacher's Symmetry**: Use previously computed palindromes to avoid redundant checks
4. **Preprocessing**: Transform string to handle even-length palindromes uniformly

## Edge Cases

1. **Single character**: `"a"` → return `"a"`
2. **All same characters**: `"aaa"` → return `"aaa"`
3. **No palindrome > 1**: `"abc"` → return `"a"` (or any single char)
4. **Two palindromes of same length**: `"babad"` → return either `"bab"` or `"aba"`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing even-length palindromes**: Forgetting to check centers between characters
2. **Index out of bounds**: Not checking bounds before accessing array
3. **Wrong expansion logic**: Not expanding symmetrically from center
4. **Manacher's preprocessing**: Forgetting to convert back to original indices
