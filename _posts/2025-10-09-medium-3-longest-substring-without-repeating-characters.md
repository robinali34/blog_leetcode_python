# [Medium] 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Solution: Sliding Window with Hash Map

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(min(m, n)) where m is the size of the charset

Use a sliding window approach with a hash map to track character positions and efficiently update the window boundaries.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        max_len = 0
        hashmap = {}
        
        start = 0
        for end in range(len(s)):
            cur = s[end]
            
            # If character exists and is within current window
            if cur in hashmap and hashmap[cur] >= start:
                start = hashmap[cur] + 1  # Move start past the duplicate
            
            hashmap[cur] = end  # Update character position
            max_len = max(max_len, end - start + 1)  # Update max length
        
        return max_len
```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Step-by-Step Example: `s = "abcabcbb"`

| Step | end | cur | hashmap | start | window | max_len |
|------|-----|-----|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 0 | 'a' | {'a': 0} | 0 | "a" | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | 'b' | {'a': 0, 'b': 1} | 0 | "ab" | 2 |
| 3 | 2 | 'c' | {'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2} | 0 | "abc" | 3 |
| 4 | 3 | 'a' | {'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'c': 2} | 1 | "bca" | 3 |
| 5 | 4 | 'b' | {'a': 3, 'b': 4, 'c': 2} | 2 | "cab" | 3 |
| 6 | 5 | 'c' | {'a': 3, 'b': 4, 'c': 5} | 3 | "abc" | 3 |
| 7 | 6 | 'b' | {'a': 3, 'b': 6, 'c': 5} | 5 | "cb" | 3 |
| 8 | 7 | 'b' | {'a': 3, 'b': 7, 'c': 5} | 7 | "b" | 3 |

**Final Answer:** 3

### Visual Representation

```
String: "abcabcbb"
        01234567

Step 1-3: "abc" (length 3)
Step 4:   "bca" (length 3) 
Step 5:   "cab" (length 3)
Step 6:   "abc" (length 3)
Step 7:   "cb"  (length 2)
Step 8:   "b"   (length 1)

Maximum length: 3
```

## Key Insights

1. **Sliding Window**: Use two pointers (`start` and `end`) to maintain a valid window
2. **Hash Map Tracking**: Store the last position of each character
3. **Efficient Updates**: When a duplicate is found, move `start` to `hashmap[cur] + 1`
4. **Single Pass**: Process each character exactly once

## Algorithm Breakdown

### 1. Initialize Variables
```python
max_len = 0
hashmap = {}  # Dictionary to store character positions
```

### 2. Expand Window
```python
start = 0
for end in range(len(s)):
    cur = s[end]
```

### 3. Handle Duplicates
```python
if cur in hashmap and hashmap[cur] >= start:
    start = hashmap[cur] + 1  # Move start past duplicate
```

### 4. Update and Track
```python
hashmap[cur] = end  # Update character position
max_len = max(max_len, end - start + 1)  # Update max length
```

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 1: Brute Force
```python
# Check all possible substrings - O(n³)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i, n):
        if isUnique(s, i, j):
            max_len = max(max_len, j - i + 1)
```

### Approach 2: Sliding Window with Set
```python
# Use set to track characters in current window
window = set()
start = 0
for end in range(len(s)):
    while s[end] in window:
        window.remove(s[start])
        start += 1
    window.add(s[end])
    max_len = max(max_len, end - start + 1)
```
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Brute Force | O(n³) | O(min(m, n)) |
| Sliding Window + Set | O(n) | O(min(m, n)) |
| Sliding Window + Hash Map | O(n) | O(min(m, n)) |

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty string**: `s = ""` → `0`
2. **Single character**: `s = "a"` → `1`
3. **All same characters**: `s = "aaaa"` → `1`
4. **No duplicates**: `s = "abcdef"` → `6`

## Why This Solution is Optimal

1. **Single Pass**: Each character is visited exactly once
2. **Efficient Lookup**: Hash map provides O(1) character position lookup
3. **Smart Window Adjustment**: Directly jumps to the correct position instead of sliding one by one
4. **Minimal Space**: Only stores character positions, not the entire substring

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not checking if duplicate is within current window**
2. **Using `start = end` instead of `start = hashmap[cur] + 1`**
3. **Forgetting to update `max_len` after each iteration**
4. **Not handling edge cases like empty string**
