# 213. House Robber II

## Problem Statement

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. **All houses at this place are arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Rob house 2 (money = 2) or house 3 (money = 3).
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Circular constraint**: Since houses are arranged in a circle, what happens if we rob the first and last house? (Assumption: Cannot rob both first and last house simultaneously - they're adjacent in the circle)

2. **Empty array**: What should we return if the array is empty? (Assumption: Based on constraints, array length is at least 1)

3. **Single house**: What if there's only one house? (Assumption: Rob that single house, return `nums[0]`)

4. **Negative values**: Can house values be negative? (Assumption: No - constraints show `0 <= nums[i]`, all non-negative)

5. **Adjacent houses**: Can we rob two adjacent houses? (Assumption: No - robbing adjacent houses triggers alarm)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to maximize robbery. Let me try all possible house combinations."

**Naive Solution**: Try all possible ways to select houses (no two adjacent), find maximum sum.

**Complexity**: O(2^n) time, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- Exponential time complexity
- Tries many invalid combinations
- Very inefficient
- Doesn't leverage optimal substructure

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "This has optimal substructure. Maximum robbery depends on previous houses, but circular constraint complicates."

**Improved Solution**: Use DP similar to LC 198, but handle circular constraint. Try two cases: rob houses [0..n-2] and [1..n-1], take maximum.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- Leverages optimal substructure
- O(n) time instead of exponential
- Handles circular constraint correctly
- Can optimize space

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Two-case DP approach is optimal. Can optimize space to O(1)."

**Best Solution**: Two-case DP: case1 = rob houses [0..n-2], case2 = rob houses [1..n-1]. Use standard House Robber DP for each case, take maximum.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(1) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Circular constraint requires two cases
2. DP is natural approach - optimal substructure
3. O(n) time is optimal
4. O(1) space is possible with optimization

## Solution Approach

This is a **circular version** of House Robber (LC 198). The key difference is that the first and last houses are adjacent, so we cannot rob both.

### Key Insights:

1. **Circular Constraint**: Cannot rob both first and last house simultaneously
2. **Break into Two Linear Problems**:
   - Case 1: Rob houses `[0..N-2]` (exclude last house)
   - Case 2: Rob houses `[1..N-1]` (exclude first house)
3. **Take Maximum**: Return `max(case1, case2)`
4. **Reuse Linear Solution**: Use the same DP logic from House Robber for each case

### Algorithm:

1. **Edge Case**: If `N == 1`, return `nums[0]`
2. **Two Cases**:
   - `rob(nums, 0, N-2)`: Rob from first to second-to-last
   - `rob(nums, 1, N-1)`: Rob from second to last
3. **Return Maximum**: `max(case1, case2)`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
/
Cycle: rtn max(robLinear(0.. N - 2), robLinear(1,.. N - 1))
dp[i] = max(dp[i-2] + nums[i], dp[i - 1])
/
def rob(self, nums):
    N = len(nums)
    if(N == 1) return nums[0]
    return max(
    rob(nums, 0, N - 2),
    rob(nums, 1, N - 1)
    )
def rob(self, nums, l, r):
    prev2 = 0, prev1 = 0
    for(i = l i <= r i += 1) :
    curr = max(prev2 + nums[i], prev1)
    prev2 = prev1
    prev1 = curr
return prev1
```

### Algorithm Explanation:

#### **Main Function `rob(nums)`:**

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `N == 1`, return `nums[0]` (only one house)

2. **Two Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: `rob(nums, 0, N-2)` - Rob houses from index 0 to N-2 (exclude last)
   - **Case 2**: `rob(nums, 1, N-1)` - Rob houses from index 1 to N-1 (exclude first)

3. **Return Maximum**: Take the maximum of both cases

#### **Helper Function `rob(nums, l, r)`:**

This implements the linear House Robber algorithm for the range `[l, r]`:

1. **State Variables**:
   - `prev2`: Maximum money up to two houses ago
   - `prev1`: Maximum money up to one house ago

2. **Iterate Through Range**:
   - For each house `i` from `l` to `r`:
     - `curr = max(prev2 + nums[i], prev1)`
       - **Rob current**: `prev2 + nums[i]` (can't rob previous)
       - **Skip current**: `prev1` (keep previous maximum)
     - Update: `prev2 = prev1`, `prev1 = curr`

3. **Return**: `prev1` (maximum for the range)

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `nums = [2,3,2]`

```
Step 1: Edge case check
  N = 3, not 1 → continue

Step 2: Case 1 - rob(nums, 0, 1) = rob([2,3])
  i=0: curr = max(0+2, 0) = 2
    prev2=0, prev1=2
  i=1: curr = max(0+3, 2) = 3
    prev2=2, prev1=3
  Result: 3

Step 3: Case 2 - rob(nums, 1, 2) = rob([3,2])
  i=1: curr = max(0+3, 0) = 3
    prev2=0, prev1=3
  i=2: curr = max(0+2, 3) = 3
    prev2=3, prev1=3
  Result: 3

Step 4: Return max(3, 3) = 3 ✓
```

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,1]`

```
Step 1: N = 4, not 1 → continue

Step 2: Case 1 - rob(nums, 0, 2) = rob([1,2,3])
  i=0: curr = max(0+1, 0) = 1 → prev2=0, prev1=1
  i=1: curr = max(0+2, 1) = 2 → prev2=1, prev1=2
  i=2: curr = max(1+3, 2) = 4 → prev2=2, prev1=4
  Result: 4

Step 3: Case 2 - rob(nums, 1, 3) = rob([2,3,1])
  i=1: curr = max(0+2, 0) = 2 → prev2=0, prev1=2
  i=2: curr = max(0+3, 2) = 3 → prev2=2, prev1=3
  i=3: curr = max(2+1, 3) = 3 → prev2=3, prev1=3
  Result: 3

Step 4: Return max(4, 3) = 4 ✓
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Two linear passes: O(n) each
  - Overall: O(n)

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Only two variables (`prev2`, `prev1`) needed
  - No extra array required
  - Overall: O(1)

## Key Insights

1. **Circular Constraint**: First and last houses are adjacent, so we can't rob both
2. **Break into Two Cases**: 
   - Exclude last house: `[0..N-2]`
   - Exclude first house: `[1..N-1]`
3. **Reuse Linear Solution**: Use the same DP logic from House Robber
4. **Space Optimization**: O(1) space using two variables instead of array
5. **Edge Case**: Single house doesn't need splitting

## Edge Cases

1. **Single house**: `nums = [5]` → return `5`
2. **Two houses**: `nums = [2,3]` → return `max(2,3) = 3`
3. **Three houses**: `nums = [2,3,2]` → return `3` (can't rob first and last)
4. **All same**: `nums = [1,1,1,1]` → return `2` (rob two non-adjacent)
5. **First and last are large**: `nums = [10,1,1,10]` → return `10` (rob either first or last)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not handling single house**: Forgetting edge case `N == 1`
2. **Wrong range**: Using `[0..N-1]` and `[1..N]` instead of `[0..N-2]` and `[1..N-1]`
3. **Including both endpoints**: Trying to include both first and last in one case
4. **Not taking maximum**: Forgetting to compare both cases
5. **Index out of bounds**: Not checking bounds when `N == 1` or `N == 2`

## Why This Works

### Circular Constraint:

Since houses are arranged in a circle, if we rob house 0, we cannot rob house N-1. This creates two mutually exclusive cases:

1. **Case 1**: Rob houses `[0..N-2]`
   - We can rob house 0, but not house N-1
   - This is a linear problem

2. **Case 2**: Rob houses `[1..N-1]`
   - We cannot rob house 0, but can rob house N-1
   - This is also a linear problem

By taking the maximum of both cases, we ensure we get the optimal solution while respecting the circular constraint.

### Visual Representation:

```
Case 1: [0..N-2] (exclude last)
  [0] [1] [2] ... [N-2] [N-1]
   ✓   ?   ?   ...   ?    ✗

Case 2: [1..N-1] (exclude first)
  [0] [1] [2] ... [N-2] [N-1]
   ✗   ?   ?   ...   ?    ✓

Result: max(case1, case2)
```

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 2: Using Array-Based DP

```python
class Solution:
def rob(self, nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if(n == 1) return nums[0]
    if n == 2) return max(nums[0], nums[1]:
    return max(
    robLinear(nums, 0, n - 2),
    robLinear(nums, 1, n - 1)
    )
def robLinear(self, nums, start, end):
    list[int> dp(end - start + 1)
    dp[0] = nums[start]
    dp[1] = max(nums[start], nums[start + 1])
    for(i = 2 i <= end - start i += 1) :
    dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[start + i])
return dp[end - start]
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

**When to Use:** When you need to trace back the optimal path
