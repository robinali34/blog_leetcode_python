# 1136. Parallel Courses

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `relations` where `relations[i] = [prevCoursei, nextCoursei]`, representing a prerequisite relationship between course `prevCoursei` and course `nextCoursei`: course `prevCoursei` has to be taken before course `nextCoursei`.

In one semester, you can take any number of courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites for the course you are taking.

Return *the **minimum number of semesters** needed to take all courses*. If there is no way to take all the courses, return `-1`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph.
In the first semester, you can take courses 1 and 2.
In the second semester, you can take course 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No course can be studied because there is a prerequisite cycle.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `1 <= relations.length <= 5000`
- `relations[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= prevCoursei, nextCoursei <= n`
- `prevCoursei != nextCoursei`
- All the pairs `[prevCoursei, nextCoursei]` are **unique**.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Cycle detection**: What should we return if there's a cycle in the prerequisites? (Assumption: Return `-1` - impossible to complete all courses)

2. **Parallel courses**: Can we take multiple courses in the same semester if they have no prerequisites or all prerequisites are satisfied? (Assumption: Yes - we can take any number of courses in parallel as long as prerequisites are met)

3. **No prerequisites**: What if a course has no prerequisites? (Assumption: It can be taken in the first semester)

4. **Semester definition**: Does each semester allow taking unlimited courses, or is there a limit? (Assumption: Unlimited courses per semester, only constraint is prerequisites)

5. **Graph representation**: Should we assume the graph is connected, or can there be disconnected components? (Assumption: Graph can have disconnected components - we need to process all courses)

## Interview Deduction Process (30 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (8 minutes)**

Try all possible course orderings and find the minimum number of semesters needed. For each semester, try all combinations of courses that can be taken (all prerequisites satisfied). This approach has exponential complexity and is infeasible. The challenge is that we need to find the optimal parallelization strategy.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (10 minutes)**

Use topological sort with level tracking. Process courses level by level, where each level represents courses that can be taken in parallel (all prerequisites satisfied). Use BFS: start with courses having no prerequisites (level 0), then courses whose prerequisites are all completed (level 1), and so on. Count the number of levels. However, this doesn't directly give the minimum semesters if we can take multiple courses per semester - we need to track the longest path.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (12 minutes)**

Use DFS with memoization to find the longest path from each node. For each course, recursively find the longest path from its prerequisites, then add 1. Memoize results to avoid recomputation. The answer is the maximum longest path length across all courses. Alternatively, use topological sort with dynamic programming: process nodes in topological order, and for each node, dp[node] = 1 + max(dp[prerequisite]). The maximum dp value is the answer. This achieves O(V + E) time complexity, which is optimal. The key insight is that the problem reduces to finding the longest path in a DAG, where we can take all courses at the same level in parallel, so the critical path determines the minimum semesters.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires finding the **longest path in a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**. If the graph contains a cycle, it's impossible to complete all courses.

### Key Insights:

1. **Graph Representation**: Courses are nodes, prerequisites are directed edges
2. **Longest Path**: The minimum semesters needed equals the length of the longest path in the DAG
3. **Cycle Detection**: If a cycle exists, return `-1`
4. **DFS with Memoization**: Use DFS to find longest path from each node, memoize results
5. **Three-State Coloring**: 
   - `0` = unvisited
   - `-1` = currently visiting (cycle detection)
   - `positive` = visited and memoized (length of longest path from this node)

## Solution: DFS with Memoization

```python
class Solution:
def minimumSemesters(self, n, relations):
    list[list[int>> graph(n + 1)
    for relation in relations:
        graph[relation[0]].append(relation[1])
    list[int> visited(n + 1, 0)
    maxLen = 1
    for(node = 1 node < n + 1 node += 1) :
    len = dfs(node, graph, visited)
    if(len == -1) return -1 # Found a cycle
    maxLen = max(maxLen, len)
return maxLen
def dfs(self, node, graph, visited):
    if visited[node] != 0:
        return visited[node]
    visited[node] = -1
    maxLen = 1
    for endNode in graph[node]:
        len = dfs(endNode, graph, visited)
        if(len == -1) return -1
        maxLen = max(maxLen, len + 1)
    visited[node] = maxLen
    return maxLen

```

### Algorithm Explanation:

#### **Step 1: Build Graph**

```python
list[list[int>> graph(n + 1)
for relation in relations:
    graph[relation[0]].append(relation[1])

```

- Build adjacency list: `graph[u]` contains all nodes that `u` points to
- `graph[prevCourse]` contains `nextCourse` (prerequisite relationship)

#### **Step 2: DFS from Each Node**

```python
for(node = 1 node < n + 1 node += 1) :
len = dfs(node, graph, visited)
if(len == -1) return -1 # Found a cycle
maxLen = max(maxLen, len)

```

- For each unvisited node, find the longest path starting from it
- If cycle detected (`len == -1`), return `-1`
- Track maximum length across all nodes

#### **Step 3: DFS with Memoization**

```python
def dfs(self, node, graph, visited):
    if visited[node] != 0:
        return visited[node]
    visited[node] = -1
    maxLen = 1
    for endNode in graph[node]:
        len = dfs(endNode, graph, visited)
        if(len == -1) return -1
        maxLen = max(maxLen, len + 1)
    visited[node] = maxLen
    return maxLen

```

**Key Operations:**

1. **Memoization Check**: If `visited[node] != 0`, return cached result
   - If `visited[node] > 0`: Already computed, return length
   - If `visited[node] == -1`: Currently visiting (cycle detected in caller)

2. **Mark as Visiting**: `visited[node] = -1`
   - Marks node as currently being processed
   - If we encounter `-1` during DFS, we found a cycle

3. **DFS on Neighbors**: For each neighbor `endNode`:
   - Recursively find longest path from `endNode`
   - If cycle found (`len == -1`), propagate `-1` up
   - Update `maxLen = max(maxLen, len + 1)`
   - `len + 1` because we're adding current node to the path

4. **Memoize Result**: `visited[node] = maxLen`
   - Store computed length for future use
   - Convert from `-1` (visiting) to positive (visited)

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `n = 3`, `relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]`

```
Step 1: Build graph
  graph[1] = [3]
  graph[2] = [3]
  graph[3] = []

Step 2: DFS from each node
  DFS from node 1:
    visited[1] = -1 (mark as visiting)
    Visit graph[1] = [3]
      DFS from node 3:
        visited[3] = -1
        graph[3] = [] (no neighbors)
        maxLen = 1
        visited[3] = 1
        return 1
    maxLen = max(1, 1+1) = 2
    visited[1] = 2
    return 2
    
  DFS from node 2:
    visited[2] = -1
    Visit graph[2] = [3]
      DFS from node 3:
        visited[3] = 1 (already computed)
        return 1
    maxLen = max(1, 1+1) = 2
    visited[2] = 2
    return 2
    
  DFS from node 3:
    visited[3] = 1 (already computed)
    return 1

Step 3: Find maximum
  maxLen = max(2, 2, 1) = 2
  
Result: return 2 ✓
```

**Cycle Detection Example:** `n = 3`, `relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]`

```
DFS from node 1:
  visited[1] = -1
  Visit graph[1] = [2]
    DFS from node 2:
      visited[2] = -1
      Visit graph[2] = [3]
        DFS from node 3:
          visited[3] = -1
          Visit graph[3] = [1]
            DFS from node 1:
              visited[1] = -1 (currently visiting!)
              return -1 (cycle detected!)
          return -1
      return -1
  return -1

Result: return -1 ✓
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
  - Building graph: O(E)
  - DFS from each node: O(V + E) total
  - Each edge visited once, each node visited once
  - Overall: O(V + E)

- **Space Complexity:** O(V + E)
  - Graph adjacency list: O(V + E)
  - Visited array: O(V)
  - Recursion stack: O(V) in worst case
  - Overall: O(V + E)

## Key Insights

1. **Longest Path in DAG**: Minimum semesters = length of longest path
   - Each node in path must be taken in sequence
   - Longest path determines minimum semesters needed

2. **Cycle Detection**: Three-state coloring
   - `0` = unvisited
   - `-1` = visiting (if encountered again, cycle exists)
   - `positive` = visited and memoized

3. **Memoization**: Avoids recomputing longest path from each node
   - Once computed, result is cached in `visited[node]`
   - Significantly improves efficiency

4. **DFS Order**: Process all neighbors before finalizing current node
   - Ensures we find longest path through all possible routes

5. **Base Case**: Node with no outgoing edges has length 1
   - Can be taken in first semester (if no prerequisites)

## Edge Cases

1. **No prerequisites**: `n = 3`, `relations = []` → return `1` (all in one semester)
2. **Cycle exists**: `n = 2`, `relations = [[1,2],[2,1]]` → return `-1`
3. **Linear chain**: `n = 4`, `relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]` → return `4`
4. **Multiple paths**: `n = 3`, `relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]` → return `2`
5. **Single node**: `n = 1`, `relations = []` → return `1`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not detecting cycles**: Forgetting to check for `-1` during DFS
2. **Wrong memoization**: Not converting `-1` to positive value after computation
3. **Wrong base case**: Returning `0` instead of `1` for leaf nodes
4. **Not finding max**: Only checking one path instead of maximum across all paths
5. **Index confusion**: Using 0-indexed vs 1-indexed nodes

## Alternative Approach: Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm)

```python
class Solution:
def minimumSemesters(self, n, relations):
    list[list[int>> graph(n + 1)
    list[int> indegree(n + 1, 0)
    for relation in relations:
        graph[relation[0]].append(relation[1])
        indegree[relation[1]]++
    deque[int> q
    for(i = 1 i <= n i += 1) :
    if indegree[i] == 0:
        q.push(i)
semesters = 0
coursesTaken = 0
while not not q:
    semesters += 1
    size = len(q)
    for(i = 0 i < size i += 1) :
    node = q[0]
    q.pop()
    coursesTaken += 1
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        indegree[neighbor]--
        if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
            q.push(neighbor)
(semesters if         return coursesTaken == n  else -1)

```
