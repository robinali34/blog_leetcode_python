# [Medium] 1976. Number of Ways to Arrive at Destination

## Problem Statement

You are in a city that consists of `n` intersections numbered from `0` to `n - 1` with **bi-directional** roads between some intersections. The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that there is **at most one** road between any two intersections.

You are given an integer `n` and an array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei]` means that there is a road between intersections `ui` and `vi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. You want to know how many ways you can travel from intersection `0` to intersection `n - 1` in the **shortest amount of time**.

Return *the **number of ways** you can arrive at your destination in the **shortest amount of time***. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 7, roads = [[0,6,7],[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[6,3,3],[3,5,1],[6,5,1],[2,5,1],[0,4,5],[4,6,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The shortest amount of time it takes to go from intersection 0 to intersection 6 is 7 minutes.
The four ways to get there in 7 minutes are:
- 0 ➜ 1 ➜ 2 ➜ 5 ➜ 6
- 0 ➜ 1 ➜ 3 ➜ 5 ➜ 6
- 0 ➜ 4 ➜ 6
- 0 ➜ 6
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2, roads = [[1,0,10]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one way to go from intersection 0 to intersection 1, and it takes 10 minutes.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `n - 1 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
- `roads[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`
- `1 <= timei <= 10^9`
- `ui != vi`
- There is at most one road connecting any two intersections.
- You can reach any intersection from any other intersection.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Graph structure**: What is the graph structure? (Assumption: Undirected weighted graph - roads connect intersections with travel times)

2. **Optimization goal**: What are we optimizing for? (Assumption: Shortest path from intersection 0 to intersection n-1)

3. **Path counting**: What should we count? (Assumption: Number of different shortest paths from 0 to n-1)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - number of shortest paths modulo 10^9 + 7)

5. **Path uniqueness**: What makes paths different? (Assumption: Different sequences of intersections - same length but different routes)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Use DFS to explore all paths from node 0 to node n-1. Keep track of the current path and total time. When reaching node n-1, record the time. After exploring all paths, find the minimum time and count how many paths have that minimum time. This approach has exponential time complexity O(2^V) in worst case, which is too slow for graphs with many nodes.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use BFS with distance tracking: perform BFS from node 0, tracking the shortest distance to each node. When multiple paths reach a node with the same distance, increment a counter. However, BFS only works for unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, we need Dijkstra's algorithm. Use Dijkstra's to find shortest distances, then use DFS or DP to count paths with shortest distance. This requires two passes and careful implementation.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Combine Dijkstra's algorithm with path counting in a single pass: use a priority queue to find shortest paths, maintaining both `shortestTime[i]` (shortest distance) and `pathCount[i]` (number of shortest paths). When exploring neighbors, if we find a shorter path, update the distance and reset the count. If we find an equal path, accumulate the count. This achieves O((V + E) log V) time complexity, which is optimal for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs. The key insight is that we can count paths during Dijkstra's execution by tracking how many ways we can reach each node with the shortest distance.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires finding the **number of shortest paths** from node `0` to node `n-1` in a weighted, undirected graph. This is a classic application of **Dijkstra's algorithm** combined with **dynamic programming** to count paths.

### Key Insights:

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Find shortest distances from source (node 0) to all nodes
2. **Path Counting**: Count number of ways to reach each node with shortest distance
3. **Multiple Paths**: When multiple paths have the same shortest distance, accumulate the count
4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Handle large numbers with `10^9 + 7`

### Algorithm:

1. **Build adjacency list**: Create graph representation from roads
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Use priority queue to find shortest paths
3. **Path Counting**: 
   - If shorter path found: update distance and reset count
   - If equal path found: add to count
4. **Return**: Number of shortest paths to destination

## Solution

### **Solution: Dijkstra's Algorithm with Path Counting**

```python
import heapq
from math import inf

class Solution:
    def countPaths(self, n, roads):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        # build graph
        adjList = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for u, v, w in roads:
            adjList[u].append((v, w))
            adjList[v].append((u, w))

        shortestTime = [inf] * n
        pathCount = [0] * n

        shortestTime[0] = 0
        pathCount[0] = 1

        minHeap = [(0, 0)]  # (time, node)

        while minHeap:
            currTime, node = heapq.heappop(minHeap)

            if currTime > shortestTime[node]:
                continue

            for neighbor, roadTime in adjList[node]:
                newTime = currTime + roadTime

                # found shorter path
                if newTime < shortestTime[neighbor]:
                    shortestTime[neighbor] = newTime
                    pathCount[neighbor] = pathCount[node]
                    heapq.heappush(minHeap, (newTime, neighbor))

                # found another shortest path
                elif newTime == shortestTime[neighbor]:
                    pathCount[neighbor] = (pathCount[neighbor] + pathCount[node]) % MOD

        return pathCount[n - 1] % MOD
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Graph Construction (Lines 5-9)**:
   - Build bidirectional adjacency list
   - Each edge stores `(neighbor, weight)`

2. **Initialization (Lines 10-15)**:
   - `shortestTime[i]`: Shortest time to reach node `i` (initialized to `LLONG_MAX`)
   - `pathCount[i]`: Number of shortest paths to node `i` (initialized to 0)
   - Start node: `shortestTime[0] = 0`, `pathCount[0] = 1`
   - Priority queue: `(time, node)` pairs, min-heap

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm (Lines 16-30)**:
   - Extract node with minimum time
   - Skip if outdated (already found shorter path)
   - For each neighbor:
     - **Shorter path found**: Update distance and reset count
     - **Equal path found**: Add to count (modulo)

4. **Result**: Return `pathCount[n-1]` - number of shortest paths to destination

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `n = 7, roads = [[0,6,7],[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[6,3,3],[3,5,1],[6,5,1],[2,5,1],[0,4,5],[4,6,2]]`:**

```
Graph:
0 --2-- 1 --3-- 2
|       |       |
7       3       1
|       |       |
6 --1-- 5 --1-- 3
|       |
2       1
|
4

Dijkstra's Execution:

Step 1: Start at node 0
- shortestTime[0] = 0, pathCount[0] = 1
- Explore: 0→1 (time=2), 0→4 (time=5), 0→6 (time=7)

Step 2: Process node 1 (time=2)
- shortestTime[1] = 2, pathCount[1] = 1
- Explore: 1→2 (time=2+3=5), 1→3 (time=2+3=5)

Step 3: Process node 4 (time=5)
- shortestTime[4] = 5, pathCount[4] = 1
- Explore: 4→6 (time=5+2=7)

Step 4: Process node 2 (time=5)
- shortestTime[2] = 5, pathCount[2] = 1
- Explore: 2→5 (time=5+1=6)

Step 5: Process node 3 (time=5)
- shortestTime[3] = 5, pathCount[3] = 1
- Explore: 3→5 (time=5+1=6), 3→6 (time=5+3=8)

Step 6: Process node 5 (time=6)
- shortestTime[5] = 6, pathCount[5] = 2 (from node 2 and 3)
- Explore: 5→6 (time=6+1=7)

Step 7: Process node 6 (time=7)
- Found paths with time=7:
  - 0→6 (direct): pathCount = 1
  - 0→4→6: pathCount = 1
  - 0→1→2→5→6: pathCount = 1
  - 0→1→3→5→6: pathCount = 1
- pathCount[6] = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Result: 4 ways to reach node 6 with shortest time 7
```

## Dijkstra's Template

Here's the general template for Dijkstra's algorithm with path counting:

```python
import heapq
from math import inf

class Solution:
    def countShortestPaths(self, n, adjList, start, end):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        dist = [inf] * n
        pathCount = [0] * n

        dist[start] = 0
        pathCount[start] = 1

        pq = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)

        while pq:
            currDist, node = heapq.heappop(pq)

            # skip outdated entry
            if currDist > dist[node]:
                continue

            for neighbor, weight in adjList[node]:
                newDist = currDist + weight

                # found shorter path
                if newDist < dist[neighbor]:
                    dist[neighbor] = newDist
                    pathCount[neighbor] = pathCount[node]
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (newDist, neighbor))

                # found another shortest path
                elif newDist == dist[neighbor]:
                    pathCount[neighbor] = (pathCount[neighbor] + pathCount[node]) % MOD

        return pathCount[end] % MOD
```

### **Key Template Components:**

1. **Data Structures**:
   - `dist[i]`: Shortest distance to node `i`
   - `pathCount[i]`: Number of shortest paths to node `i`
   - Priority queue: Min-heap for Dijkstra's

2. **Initialization**:
   - Start node: `dist[start] = 0`, `pathCount[start] = 1`
   - All other nodes: `dist[i] = INF`, `pathCount[i] = 0`

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Extract minimum distance node
   - Skip outdated entries
   - Update neighbors:
     - **Shorter**: Update distance, reset count
     - **Equal**: Accumulate count

4. **Modulo**: Apply `MOD` to prevent overflow

## Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity:** O((V + E) log V)
- **Priority queue operations**: O(E log V) - each edge processed once
- **Graph traversal**: O(V + E) - visit all nodes and edges
- **Total**: O((V + E) log V) where V = n, E = number of roads

### **Space Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **Adjacency list**: O(E) - store all edges
- **Distance array**: O(V) - store distances for all nodes
- **Path count array**: O(V) - store counts for all nodes
- **Priority queue**: O(V) - at most V nodes in queue
- **Total**: O(V + E)

## Key Points

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths in weighted graphs with non-negative edges
2. **Path Counting**: Track number of ways to reach each node with shortest distance
3. **Multiple Paths**: When multiple paths have same distance, accumulate counts
4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Handle large numbers with `10^9 + 7`
5. **Bidirectional Graph**: Roads are undirected (both directions)
6. **Outdated Skip**: Skip nodes with outdated distances in priority queue

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: Dijkstra + DP (Current Solution)**
- **Time**: O((V + E) log V)
- **Space**: O(V + E)
- **Best for**: General graphs with non-negative weights

### **Approach 2: BFS (Unweighted Graphs Only)**
- **Time**: O(V + E)
- **Space**: O(V + E)
- **Limitation**: Only works for unweighted graphs

### **Approach 3: Floyd-Warshall (All Pairs)**
- **Time**: O(V³)
- **Space**: O(V²)
- **Use case**: Need shortest paths between all pairs
