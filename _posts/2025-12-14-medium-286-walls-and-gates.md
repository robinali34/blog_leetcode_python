# [Medium] 286. Walls and Gates

You are given an `m x n` grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values:

- `-1` A wall or an obstacle.
- `0` A gate.
- `INF` Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `2^31 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should remain `INF`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: rooms = [[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]]
Output: [[3,-1,0,1],[2,2,1,-1],[1,-1,2,-1],[0,-1,3,4]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: rooms = [[-1]]
Output: [[-1]]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: rooms = [[2147483647]]
Output: [[2147483647]]
```

## Constraints

- `m == rooms.length`
- `n == rooms[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 250`
- `rooms[i][j]` is `-1`, `0`, or `2^31 - 1`.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Cell types**: What do the values represent? (Assumption: -1 = wall (obstacle), 0 = gate, 2^31-1 = empty room (INF))

2. **Distance calculation**: How is distance calculated? (Assumption: Minimum steps from nearest gate to each empty room - BFS distance)

3. **Modification requirement**: Should we modify the grid? (Assumption: Yes - replace INF values with actual distances from nearest gate)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Void - modify rooms array in-place)

5. **Movement rules**: How can we move? (Assumption: Horizontal or vertical movement - 4 directions, cannot pass through walls)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

For each empty room (INF value), run BFS to find the nearest gate. Update the room with the distance found. This approach has O(m × n × (m × n)) time complexity in worst case, which is too slow for large grids.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Start BFS from each gate separately, updating distances as we go. However, this still requires multiple BFS passes, and we need to track the minimum distance across all gates for each room, which adds complexity.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use multi-source BFS: initialize the queue with all gates (distance 0). Perform BFS from all gates simultaneously. When visiting a room, if the current distance is smaller than the stored value, update it and add neighbors to the queue. This achieves O(m × n) time - we visit each cell at most once. The key insight is that BFS naturally finds shortest paths, and starting from all gates simultaneously ensures each room gets the distance from its nearest gate in a single pass.

## Solution 1: Multi-Source BFS (Recommended)

**Time Complexity:** O(m × n) - Each cell is visited at most once  
**Space Complexity:** O(m × n) - For the queue

This solution uses BFS starting from all gates simultaneously. Since BFS guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs, each empty room will be filled with the distance to its nearest gate.

```python
class Solution:
EMPTY = INT_MAX
GATE = 0
dirs[4][2] = ::1, 0, :-1, 0, :0, 1, :0, -1
def wallsAndGates(self, rooms):
    ROWS = len(rooms), COLS = rooms[0].__len__()
    if(ROWS == 0  or  COLS == 0) return
    deque[pair<int, int>> q
    # Add all gates to queue (multi-source BFS)
    for(row = 0 row < ROWS row += 1) :
    for(col = 0 col < COLS col += 1) :
    if rooms[row][col] == GATE:
        q.push(:row, col)
# BFS from all gates simultaneously
while not not q:
    [row, col] = q[0]
    q.pop()
    for dir in dirs:
        nrow = row + dir[0]
        ncol = col + dir[1]
        # Skip if out of bounds, wall, or already visited (not EMPTY)
        if(nrow < 0  or  nrow >= ROWS  or  ncol < 0  or  ncol >= COLS  or
        rooms[nrow][ncol] != EMPTY) :
        continue
    # Update distance and add to queue
    rooms[nrow][ncol] = rooms[row][col] + 1
    q.push(:nrow, ncol)

```

### How Solution 1 Works

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Find all gates (value 0) and add them to the queue
   - Gates are the starting points for BFS

2. **Multi-Source BFS**:
   - Process all gates simultaneously
   - For each gate's neighbor:
     - If it's an empty room (`EMPTY`), update its distance
     - Distance = current cell's distance + 1
     - Add to queue for further exploration

3. **Key Insight**:
   - BFS guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs
   - By starting from all gates, each empty room gets the distance to its **nearest** gate
   - Walls (`-1`) are skipped, empty rooms are updated in-place

### Why Multi-Source BFS?

- **Single-source BFS** would require running BFS from each gate separately → O(k × m × n) where k is number of gates
- **Multi-source BFS** processes all gates together → O(m × n)
- Each cell is visited once, and the first visit (from nearest gate) sets the correct distance

## Solution 2: DFS (Alternative - Less Efficient)

**Time Complexity:** O((m × n)^2) in worst case  
**Space Complexity:** O(m × n) - Recursion stack

DFS approach starting from each gate. Less efficient because it may revisit cells multiple times.

```python
class Solution:
EMPTY = INT_MAX
GATE = 0
dirs[4][2] = ::1, 0, :-1, 0, :0, 1, :0, -1
def dfs(self, rooms, row, col, distance):
    if(row < 0  or  row >= len(rooms)  or  col < 0  or  col >= rooms[0].__len__()  or
    rooms[row][col] < distance) :
    return
rooms[row][col] = distance
for dir in dirs:
    dfs(rooms, row + dir[0], col + dir[1], distance + 1)
def wallsAndGates(self, rooms):
    ROWS = len(rooms), COLS = rooms[0].__len__()
    if(ROWS == 0  or  COLS == 0) return
    # Start DFS from each gate
    for(row = 0 row < ROWS row += 1) :
    for(col = 0 col < COLS col += 1) :
    if rooms[row][col] == GATE:
        dfs(rooms, row, col, 0)

```

### How Solution 2 Works

1. **DFS from each gate**: Start DFS from every gate with distance 0
2. **Pruning**: If current distance >= existing distance in cell, skip (already found shorter path)
3. **Update**: Set cell to current distance and continue DFS

### Why BFS is Better

- **BFS**: Guarantees shortest path, each cell visited once
- **DFS**: May revisit cells, requires pruning check, less efficient

## Comparison of Approaches

| Aspect | Multi-Source BFS | DFS |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| **Time Complexity** | O(m×n) | O((m×n)²) worst case |
| **Space Complexity** | O(m×n) | O(m×n) |
| **Optimality** | Guaranteed shortest path | Requires pruning |
| **Code Simplicity** | Excellent | Good |
| **Efficiency** | Better | Less efficient |

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:** 
```
rooms = [
  [INF, -1,  0,  INF],
  [INF, INF, INF, -1 ],
  [INF, -1,  INF, -1 ],
  [0,   -1,  INF, INF]
]
```

### Solution 1 (Multi-Source BFS):

```
Step 1: Find all gates
  Gates at: (0,2) and (3,0)
  Queue: [(0,2), (3,0)]

Step 2: BFS from gates
  Process (0,2):
    Neighbors: (1,2), (-1,2), (0,1), (0,3)
    Valid: (1,2), (0,3)
    Update: rooms[1][2] = 1, rooms[0][3] = 1
    Queue: [(3,0), (1,2), (0,3)]
  
  Process (3,0):
    Neighbors: (4,0), (2,0), (3,1), (3,-1)
    Valid: (2,0)
    Update: rooms[2][0] = 1
    Queue: [(1,2), (0,3), (2,0)]
  
  Process (1,2):
    Neighbors: (2,2), (0,2), (1,1), (1,3)
    Valid: (2,2), (1,1)
    Update: rooms[2][2] = 2, rooms[1][1] = 2
    Queue: [(0,3), (2,0), (2,2), (1,1)]
  
  Continue until queue is empty...

Final Result:
[
  [3, -1,  0,  1],
  [2,  2,  1, -1],
  [1, -1,  2, -1],
  [0, -1,  3,  4]
]
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Find all gates | O(m×n) | O(1) |
| BFS traversal | O(m×n) | O(m×n) |
| **Overall** | **O(m×n)** | **O(m×n)** |

## Edge Cases

1. **No gates**: All rooms remain `INF`
2. **No empty rooms**: Only walls and gates
3. **Single cell**: `[[-1]]` or `[[0]]` or `[[INF]]`
4. **All gates**: Every cell is a gate
5. **Isolated rooms**: Rooms that cannot reach any gate remain `INF`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Single-source BFS**: Running BFS from each gate separately (inefficient)
2. **Not checking bounds**: Forgetting to check array bounds before accessing
3. **Wrong condition**: Using `rooms[nrow][ncol] == EMPTY` instead of `!= EMPTY` for visited check
4. **Distance calculation**: Forgetting to add 1 when updating distance
5. **Modifying input**: Not handling the case where input is empty

## Key Insights

1. **Multi-source BFS**: Start from all gates simultaneously for efficiency
2. **In-place update**: Use the grid itself to track distances (no extra space needed)
3. **BFS guarantees shortest path**: First visit to a cell gives the shortest distance
4. **Walls are obstacles**: Skip walls (`-1`) during traversal
5. **Empty check**: Only process cells that are `EMPTY` (not yet visited)

## Optimization Tips

1. **Early termination**: Not applicable here (need to fill all rooms)
2. **Space optimization**: Solution 1 uses grid itself, no extra distance array
3. **Direction array**: Using constant array for directions is cleaner than nested loops
