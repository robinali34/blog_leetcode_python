So you've heard about LeetCode but aren't sure where to start? Or maybe you've opened a problem, stared at it for 30 minutes, and closed the tab? You're not alone -- everyone starts there.

This guide walks you through everything step by step: what LeetCode actually is, how to use it, what the difficulty levels mean, and exactly which problems to solve first. No prior algorithm experience required.

> **New to Python?** Check out the [Python 3 Guide](/python-guide/) to learn the language alongside this guide.

## What Is LeetCode?

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a website with **3000+** coding puzzles. Each puzzle gives you a problem, and you write code to solve it. Think of it like a gym for your brain -- instead of lifting weights, you're training your problem-solving muscles.

**People use LeetCode for:**

- **Getting a tech job** -- companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft ask LeetCode-style questions in interviews. It's the standard.
- **Learning algorithms** -- the problems teach you patterns (sorting, searching, graph traversal) that come up everywhere in real software.
- **Competitive programming** -- if you want to compete in ICPC, Codeforces, or AtCoder, LeetCode is a great starting point.

**What makes it different from tutorials?** LeetCode doesn't teach you theory then quiz you. It throws you into a problem, and you figure out which technique applies. That's exactly what interviews and real engineering feel like.

## How the Platform Works

### What a Problem Looks Like

Every LeetCode problem has four parts:

| Part | What It Tells You | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Description** | The problem statement | Read carefully -- every word matters |
| **Examples** | Sample input → expected output | Work through these by hand before coding |
| **Constraints** | How large the input can be | Tells you which approaches are fast enough |
| **Follow-up** | An optional harder challenge | Ignore this at first, come back later |

### Your First Submission

Here's exactly what happens when you solve a problem:

1. **Pick a language** -- Python, C++, Java, or others (new to Python? See the [Python 3 Guide](/python-guide/))
2. **Write your code** in the browser editor
3. **Click "Run"** -- tests your code against the visible examples
4. **Click "Submit"** -- tests against hundreds of hidden test cases
5. **Get a verdict:**

| Verdict | What It Means | What to Do |
|---|---|---|
| **Accepted (AC)** | Your code is correct and fast enough | Celebrate, then read other solutions |
| **Wrong Answer (WA)** | Incorrect output on some test case | Check edge cases and logic |
| **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)** | Too slow | You need a faster algorithm |
| **Memory Limit Exceeded (MLE)** | Uses too much memory | Optimize your data structures |
| **Runtime Error (RE)** | Crash (null pointer, out of bounds, etc.) | Check array bounds and null checks |

Don't be discouraged by WA or TLE -- they're normal, even for experienced programmers. Each failed submission teaches you something.

### The Secret Cheat Sheet: Reading Constraints

Here's something most beginners miss: **the constraints section tells you which algorithm to use.** The input size directly determines what time complexity is acceptable:

| Input size `n` | Target Complexity | What This Means | Typical Approaches |
|---|---|---|---|
| $n \le 10$ | $O(n!)$ or $O(2^n)$ | Try everything | Brute force, backtracking |
| $n \le 20$ | $O(2^n)$ | Subsets / states | Bitmask DP |
| $n \le 500$ | $O(n^3)$ | Triple loop is OK | Floyd-Warshall, matrix DP |
| $n \le 5{,}000$ | $O(n^2)$ | Double loop is OK | DP, two pointers |
| $n \le 10^5$ | $O(n \log n)$ | Sort + scan | Sorting, binary search |
| $n \le 10^6$ | $O(n)$ | Single pass | Hash map, sliding window |
| $n \le 10^9$ | $O(\log n)$ | No array at all | Binary search on answer, math |

**Example:** If a problem says $1 \le n \le 10^5$, an $O(n^2)$ solution will be too slow ($10^{10}$ operations). You need $O(n \log n)$ or better -- think sorting or binary search.

## Difficulty Levels Explained

LeetCode marks every problem as Easy, Medium, or Hard. Here's what that actually means in practice:

### Easy -- "Learn the building blocks"

You need **one** technique and the path is usually obvious. If you know the right data structure, the code writes itself.

**You'll use:** Arrays, hash maps, basic string operations, simple loops.

**Examples (try these first!):**
- [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) -- "Can I look up values instantly?" Yes: use a hash map.
- [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/) -- Pure pointer manipulation, no tricks.
- [104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/) -- Your first recursion problem.

**Benchmark:** Can you solve a new Easy in 10-15 minutes? If not, keep practicing at this level. There's no shame in it -- foundations matter.

### Medium -- "This is where interviews live"

You need to **recognize a pattern** and sometimes combine two techniques. The approach isn't always obvious -- that's the challenge.

**You'll use:** BFS/DFS, dynamic programming, sliding window, binary search, graphs.

**Examples:**
- [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) -- "I see a grid, I need to explore connected regions." DFS or BFS.
- [322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/) -- "Minimize something with choices at each step." Classic DP.
- [146. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/) -- Combine a hash map with a linked list. Design problems test your ability to compose data structures.

**Benchmark:** Solve in 20-30 minutes. Most of your practice time should be here.

### Hard -- "Come back later"

Multiple techniques, tricky edge cases, or a key insight that's genuinely difficult to find. These test mastery, not learning.

**Examples:**
- [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) -- Two pointers or monotonic stack
- [295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/) -- Two heaps working together
- [329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/) -- DFS + memoization on a grid

**Don't start here.** Seriously. Come back after you're comfortable solving Medium problems. Hard problems build on patterns you learn from Medium.

## Your Roadmap: From Zero to Interview-Ready

Don't try to learn everything at once. Follow these phases in order -- each one builds on the last.

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4) -- "Get comfortable"

**Goal:** Solve Easy problems without getting stuck. Build muscle memory with basic data structures.

**What to learn:**
- **Arrays and strings** -- looping, indexing, basic manipulation
- **Hash maps** -- the single most useful data structure in interviews (instant lookup)
- **Linked lists** -- pointer manipulation (this feels weird at first, that's normal)
- **Stacks and queues** -- LIFO vs FIFO, when to use each
- **Basic recursion** -- "solve a smaller version of the same problem"

> **Learning Python alongside?** Work through Stages 1-2 of the [Python 3 Guide](/python-guide/) in parallel.

**Start with these 10 problems (in order):**

| # | Problem | Topic |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | Hash Map |
| 217 | [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) | Hash Set |
| 242 | [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) | Hash Map / Sorting |
| 20 | [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/) | Stack |
| 206 | [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/) | Linked List |
| 21 | [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/) | Linked List |
| 121 | [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/) | Array / Greedy |
| 70 | [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/) | Basic DP |
| 104 | [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/) | Tree / Recursion |
| 226 | [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/) | Tree / Recursion |

### Phase 2: Core Patterns (Weeks 5-12) -- "Learn to recognize"

**Goal:** When you see a new problem, you can say "This looks like a sliding window problem" or "This is DFS on a grid." Pattern recognition is the core skill.

**The 9 patterns that cover 90% of interview questions:**

| Pattern | Key Problems | Template |
|---|---|---|
| Sliding Window | 3, 76, 424, 567 | [Arrays & Strings](/posts/2025-10-29-leetcode-templates-arrays-strings/) |
| Two Pointers | 15, 11, 167, 42 | [Arrays & Strings](/posts/2025-10-29-leetcode-templates-arrays-strings/) |
| Binary Search | 33, 34, 153, 875 | [Search](/posts/2026-01-20-leetcode-templates-search/) |
| BFS / DFS | 200, 133, 695, 994 | [BFS](/posts/2025-11-24-leetcode-templates-bfs/), [DFS](/posts/2025-11-24-leetcode-templates-dfs/) |
| Dynamic Programming | 70, 198, 322, 300 | [DP](/posts/2025-10-29-leetcode-templates-dp/) |
| Backtracking | 46, 78, 39, 79 | [Backtracking](/posts/2025-11-24-leetcode-templates-backtracking/) |
| Graphs | 207, 210, 743, 261 | [Graph](/posts/2025-10-29-leetcode-templates-graph/) |
| Heap / Priority Queue | 215, 347, 295 | [Heap](/posts/2026-01-05-leetcode-templates-heap/) |
| Monotonic Stack | 84, 739, 496 | [Stack](/posts/2025-11-13-leetcode-templates-stack/) |

**How to study each pattern:**
1. Read the template page linked above -- understand the general approach
2. Solve 3-5 problems in that category
3. **Stuck for 20+ minutes?** That's OK. Read the editorial, understand it, then **re-solve from scratch the next day** without looking. This is where real learning happens.
4. Move to the next pattern once you can solve new problems in the category without hints

### Phase 3: Competition Readiness (Weeks 13+) -- "Get fast"

**Goal:** Solve 2-3 Medium problems in 60 minutes under time pressure.

**How to practice:**
- **Timed sessions** -- set a 60-minute timer, pick 2 random Medium problems
- **Weekly contests** -- LeetCode runs one every Sunday (4 problems, 90 minutes). Just try it -- you'll probably only solve 1-2 at first, and that's fine.
- **Retry list** -- every problem you couldn't solve goes on a list. Revisit it weekly.
- **Codeforces Div 2** -- problems A and B are comparable to LeetCode Easy/Medium, but with a competitive twist

**Advanced topics (when you're ready):**

| Topic | What It's For | Template |
|---|---|---|
| Segment Tree / BIT | Range queries and updates | [Data Structures](/posts/2025-10-29-leetcode-templates-data-structures/) |
| Topological Sort | Ordering tasks with dependencies | [Graph](/posts/2025-10-29-leetcode-templates-graph/) |
| Union Find (DSU) | Grouping connected components | [Graph](/posts/2025-10-29-leetcode-templates-graph/) |
| Bit Manipulation | Power-of-2 tricks, subset enumeration | [Math & Bit](/posts/2025-11-24-leetcode-templates-math-bit-manipulation/) |
| Advanced DP | Bitmask DP, digit DP, tree DP | [DP](/posts/2025-10-29-leetcode-templates-dp/) |

## The Must-Know Problem Lists

## Practical Tips That Actually Help

### When You're Stuck (This Will Happen a Lot)

Getting stuck is **normal** and **part of the process.** Here's a concrete checklist:

1. **Re-read the constraints** -- they tell you which algorithm to use (see the cheat sheet above)
2. **Draw it out** -- literally use pen and paper. Trace through the example step by step.
3. **Ask yourself: "What data structure would make this easier?"**
   - "I need instant lookup" → hash map
   - "I need sorted order" → heap, BST, or `set`
   - "I need to undo / go back" → stack
   - "I need to process in order" → queue
4. **After 25 minutes, read the editorial.** Don't waste 2 hours staring. Learning from solutions is still learning.
5. **The crucial step:** Re-solve the problem the next day **without looking at the solution.** This is where the learning actually sticks.

### The 5 Most Common Beginner Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | The Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Jumping to Hard problems | You lack the patterns that Hard problems build on | Complete Phase 1 and 2 first |
| Memorizing code | You can reproduce one solution but can't adapt to variants | Focus on **why** the approach works, not the exact code |
| Never timing yourself | Interviews have time limits; untimed practice doesn't prepare you | Set a timer. Every time. |
| Only solving comfortable categories | Your weak areas stay weak | Track which categories you struggle with and prioritize them |
| Ignoring edge cases | Costs you "Accepted" on problems you otherwise solved | Always test: empty input, single element, all same values, maximum input size |

### Which Language Should I Use?

| Language | Best For | Trade-offs | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Python** | Interviews, rapid prototyping, readable solutions | Slower runtime on tight constraints; use PyPy or optimize hot loops | [Python 3 Guide](/python-guide/) |
| **C++** | Competitive programming, maximum speed | More verbose, but STL is powerful | — |
| **Java** | Enterprise interviews, strong typing | Verbose, slower than C++ | — |

**Bottom line:** This blog uses **Python** for all solutions. For interviews, use whatever language you're most comfortable with. The algorithm matters more than the language.

## Getting the Most Out of LeetCode

| Feature | What It Does | When to Use It |
|---|---|---|
| **Study Plans** | Daily curated problem sets | Great for building consistency |
| **Weekly Contests** | 4 problems, 90 min, every Sunday | Start joining once you can solve Medium problems |
| **Discussion Tab** | Other people's solutions | Read after every problem -- even ones you solved |
| **Company Tags** (Premium) | Which companies ask which problems | Useful when preparing for a specific interview |
| **Playground** | Quick code sandbox | Test snippets without creating a submission |

## What Comes After LeetCode?

Once you can consistently solve 2-3 Medium problems in a timed session:

1. **LeetCode Weekly Contests** -- measure yourself against others
2. **Codeforces Div 2** -- problems A and B are similar difficulty, but the contest format is different
3. **AtCoder** -- exceptional problem quality, especially for dynamic programming
4. **Books to level up:**
   - *Competitive Programming 3* by Steven Halim
   - *Guide to Competitive Programming* by Antti Laaksonen

Remember: the goal isn't to solve every problem. It's to **recognize patterns quickly** and **write correct solutions under pressure.**
