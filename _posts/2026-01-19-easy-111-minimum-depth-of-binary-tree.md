# [Easy] 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, find its **minimum depth**.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the **shortest path** from the root node down to the nearest **leaf node**.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum depth is 2, which is the path: 3 → 9.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: The minimum depth is 5, which is the path: 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10^5]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Minimum depth definition**: What defines minimum depth - path to nearest leaf? (Assumption: Yes - minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from root to nearest leaf)

2. **Leaf node**: What is considered a leaf node? (Assumption: A node with no children - both left and right are null)

3. **Empty tree**: What should we return for an empty tree? (Assumption: Return 0 - no nodes means depth 0)

4. **Skewed tree**: How should we handle a skewed tree (all nodes on one side)? (Assumption: Minimum depth equals the number of nodes in the skewed path)

5. **Tree modification**: Should we modify the tree or just traverse it? (Assumption: Just traverse - no modification needed)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)**

Use DFS to explore all paths from root to leaves, track the depth of each path, and return the minimum depth found. This approach works but explores all paths, which may be inefficient for large trees.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)**

Use BFS (level-order traversal): traverse the tree level by level, return the depth when we encounter the first leaf node. BFS naturally finds the shortest path, so the first leaf we encounter will be at minimum depth. This achieves O(n) time in worst case but can be faster if the minimum depth is small.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)**

Use BFS with early termination: perform level-order traversal, increment depth at each level. When we encounter a leaf node (node with no children), return the current depth immediately. This achieves O(n) time in worst case but O(min_depth) time in best case, which is optimal. Alternatively, use DFS with proper handling: for each node, if it's a leaf, return 1. Otherwise, recursively find minimum depth of left and right subtrees, but handle the case where one subtree is null (should use the non-null subtree's depth). The key insight is that BFS naturally finds the shortest path, making it ideal for finding minimum depth.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires finding the shortest path from root to any leaf node. The key difference from maximum depth is handling nodes with only one child correctly.

### Key Insights:

1. **Leaf Node**: Node with no children (both left and right are null)
2. **Single Child**: If a node has only one child, we must follow that child (can't use null as depth 0)
3. **Both Children**: Take minimum of left and right subtree depths
4. **Base Case**: Empty tree has depth 0

## Solution: Recursive DFS (Handling Single Child)

```python
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0
            if not root.left and not root.right:
                return 1
                min_dep = float('inf')
                if root.left:
                    min_dep = min(min_dep, self.minDepth(root.left))
                    if root.right:
                        min_dep = min(min_dep, self.minDepth(root.right))
                        return min_dep + 1




```

### Algorithm Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: If root is `nullptr`, return 0

2. **Leaf Node Check**: If both children are null, return 1 (leaf node)

3. **Single Child Handling**:
   - Initialize `minDep = INT_MAX`
   - Only consider non-null children
   - If `root->left` exists, recursively find its minimum depth
   - If `root->right` exists, recursively find its minimum depth
   - Update `minDep` with the minimum of existing children

4. **Return**: `minDep + 1` (add current node to depth)

### Why This Approach?

The key insight is that we **cannot** use `min(minDepth(left), minDepth(right))` directly when one child is null, because:
- If left is null, `minDepth(left)` returns 0
- Taking `min(0, right_depth)` would incorrectly return 0
- We must only consider non-null children

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`

```
Tree structure:
      3
     / \
    9   20
       /  \
      15   7

minDepth(3):
  root = 3, has both children
  minDep = INT_MAX
  
  left = minDepth(9):
    root = 9, no children → leaf node
    return 1
  
  minDep = min(INT_MAX, 1) = 1
  
  right = minDepth(20):
    root = 20, has both children
    minDep = INT_MAX
    
    left = minDepth(15):
      root = 15, no children → leaf node
      return 1
    
    minDep = min(INT_MAX, 1) = 1
    
    right = minDepth(7):
      root = 7, no children → leaf node
      return 1
    
    minDep = min(1, 1) = 1
    return 1 + 1 = 2
  
  minDep = min(1, 2) = 1
  return 1 + 1 = 2 ✓
```

**Input:** `root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]` (skewed tree)

```
Tree structure:
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6

minDepth(2):
  root = 2, only right child
  minDep = INT_MAX
  
  left = null → skip
  
  right = minDepth(3):
    root = 3, only right child
    minDep = INT_MAX
    
    right = minDepth(4):
      ... (continues recursively)
      
      Eventually reaches leaf node 6:
        return 1
      
      Backtrack: 5 → 4 → 3 → 2
      Each adds 1
    
    return 5
  
  return 5 + 1 = 6
  
Wait, but the answer should be 5. Let me recalculate:
  Actually, the depth is 5 nodes: 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6
  
  minDepth(6): return 1
  minDepth(5): return 1 + 1 = 2
  minDepth(4): return 2 + 1 = 3
  minDepth(3): return 3 + 1 = 4
  minDepth(2): return 4 + 1 = 5 ✓
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Visit each node exactly once
  - n = number of nodes in tree

- **Space Complexity:** O(h)
  - Recursion call stack depth = height of tree
  - Best case (balanced): O(log n)
  - Worst case (skewed): O(n)

## Alternative Approaches

### Solution 2: Simplified Recursive DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0
            # If left subtree is null, only right side matters
            if not root.left:
                return 1 + self.minDepth(root.right)
                # If right subtree is null, only left side matters
                if not root.right:
                    return 1 + self.minDepth(root.left)
                    # Both subtrees exist, take the minimum
                    return 1 + min(self.minDepth(root.left), self.minDepth(root.right))




```

**Key Difference**: Explicitly handles single-child cases before computing min

**Complexity**: Same as Solution 1

### Solution 3: Iterative BFS (Level-order Traversal)

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0
            q = deque([root])
            depth = 0
            while q:
                sz = len(q)
                depth += 1
                for _ in range(sz):
                    curr = q.popleft()
                    if not curr.left and not curr.right:
                        return depth
                        if curr.left:
                            q.append(curr.left)
                            if curr.right:
                                q.append(curr.right)
                                return depth




```

**Algorithm**:
1. Use BFS to traverse level by level
2. Track depth by incrementing at the start of each level
3. Process all nodes at current level
4. **Early termination**: First leaf node encountered gives minimum depth
5. Return immediately when leaf is found

**Key Features**:
- **Level-by-level processing**: Process all nodes at current depth before moving to next
- **Early exit**: Return as soon as first leaf is found (optimal for shallow trees)
- **No depth storage**: Depth tracked by level counter, not stored per node

**Example Walkthrough**:

**Input:** `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`

```
Tree structure:
      3
     / \
    9   20
       /  \
      15   7

Level 0: depth = 0
Level 1: depth = 1, process [3]
  Check: 3 has children → continue
  Add: 9, 20 to queue

Level 2: depth = 2, process [9, 20]
  Check 9: no children → LEAF FOUND!
  Return depth = 2 ✓
```

**Complexity**:
- Time: O(n) - worst case visit all nodes, but can stop early
- Space: O(w) - where w is maximum width (worst case O(n))

**Advantage**: Can stop early when first leaf is found, optimal for trees with shallow leaves

### Solution 4: Iterative DFS with Stack

```python
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0
        st = [(root, 1)]
        min_depth = float('inf')
        while st:
            node, depth = st.pop()
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                min_depth = min(min_depth, depth)
            if node.right:
                st.append((node.right, depth + 1))
            if node.left:
                st.append((node.left, depth + 1))
        return min_depth

```

**Complexity**: Same as recursive DFS

## Key Differences from Maximum Depth

| Aspect | Maximum Depth | Minimum Depth |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Formula** | `1 + max(left, right)` | `1 + min(left, right)` |
| **Null Handling** | Can use `max(0, depth)` | Must skip null children |
| **Single Child** | Works with `max(0, child)` | Must only consider non-null child |
| **Early Termination** | No early exit possible | BFS can stop at first leaf |

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty tree**: `root = null` → return `0`
2. **Single node**: `root = [1]` → return `1`
3. **Skewed tree**: `[2,null,3,null,4]` → return `3` (must follow the only path)
4. **Balanced tree**: `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]` → return `2` (shortest path: 3 → 9)
5. **One child only**: `[1,2,null]` → return `2` (can't use null as depth 0)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong null handling**: Using `min(minDepth(left), minDepth(right))` when one is null
   ```cpp
   // WRONG:
   return 1 + min(minDepth(root->left), minDepth(root->right));
   // If left is null, minDepth(left) = 0, min(0, right) = 0 ❌
   ```

2. **Not checking leaf**: Forgetting to return 1 for leaf nodes
3. **Base case error**: Returning wrong value for null node
4. **Off-by-one**: Counting edges instead of nodes
5. **Missing single-child check**: Not handling nodes with only one child

## Comparison of Approaches

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Recursive DFS (Provided)** | O(n) | O(h) | Handles single child correctly | May explore deep paths unnecessarily |
| **Simplified Recursive DFS** | O(n) | O(h) | Cleaner code, explicit handling | Same as above |
| **Iterative BFS** | O(n) | O(w) | Can stop early at first leaf | More space for wide trees |
| **Iterative DFS** | O(n) | O(h) | No recursion overhead | More complex than recursive |

## When to Use Each Approach

- **Recursive DFS**: Most common, simplest solution
- **Simplified Recursive DFS**: When you want cleaner code
- **Iterative BFS**: When shallow leaves exist early (can optimize)
- **Iterative DFS**: When avoiding recursion

*This problem demonstrates the importance of **correctly handling single-child nodes** when finding minimum depth. Unlike maximum depth, we cannot treat null children as having depth 0, as that would incorrectly shorten the path to a leaf.*
