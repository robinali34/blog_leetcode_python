# 133. Clone Graph

## Problem Statement

Given a reference of a node in a **connected undirected graph**.

Return a **deep copy** (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val=1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val=2) and 4th node (val=4).
2nd node (val=2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val=1) and 3rd node (val=3).
3rd node (val=3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val=2) and 4th node (val=4).
4th node (val=4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val=1) and 3rd node (val=3).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val=1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not contain any nodes.
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `Node.val` is unique for each node.
- There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The graph is connected and undirected.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires creating a **deep copy** of a graph, meaning we need to create new nodes with the same structure and relationships as the original graph.

### Key Insights:

1. **Deep copy**: Create new nodes, not just copy references
2. **Graph traversal**: Need to visit all nodes and their neighbors
3. **Avoid cycles**: Use visited tracking to prevent infinite loops
4. **Node mapping**: Map original nodes to cloned nodes
5. **Two approaches**: BFS (iterative) or DFS (recursive)

### Algorithm:

1. **Create node mapping**: `unordered_map<Node*, Node*>` to track cloned nodes
2. **Traverse graph**: Visit all nodes using BFS or DFS
3. **Clone nodes**: Create new nodes with same values
4. **Build relationships**: Connect cloned nodes based on original relationships
5. **Return root**: Return the cloned version of the starting node

## Solution

### **Solution 1: BFS (Iterative)**

```python
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {

    # val = 0
    # neighbors = []
    # def __init__(self, val=0, neighbors=None):
    #     self.val = val
    #     self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
*/

from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node:
            return None
        visited = {}
        q = deque([node])
        visited[node] = Node(node.val)
        while q:
            curr = q.popleft()
            for neighbor in curr.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val)
                    q.append(neighbor)
                visited[curr].neighbors.append(visited[neighbor])
        return visited[node]
```

### **Solution 2: DFS (Recursive)**

```python
class Solution:
    def dfs(self, node: 'Node', visited: dict) -> 'Node':
        if node in visited:
            return visited[node]
        
        clone = Node(node.val)
        visited[node] = clone
        for neighbor in node.neighbors:
            clone.neighbors.append(self.dfs(neighbor, visited))
        return clone
    
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if node is None:
            return None
        visited = {}
        return self.dfs(node, visited)
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

#### **BFS Approach:**
1. **Initialize**: Create visited map and queue
2. **Start**: Add original node to queue and create its clone
3. **Process**: For each node in queue:
   - Create clones for unvisited neighbors
   - Add neighbors to queue for processing
   - Connect cloned nodes to their cloned neighbors
4. **Return**: Return cloned version of starting node

#### **DFS Approach:**
1. **Base case**: If node already cloned, return cloned version
2. **Create clone**: Make new node with same value
3. **Recursive**: For each neighbor, recursively clone and connect
4. **Return**: Return the cloned node

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For graph with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4:**

```
Original Graph:
    1
   / \
  2---3
   \ /
    4

BFS Process:
1. Start with node 1, create clone(1)
2. Process node 1: create clone(2), clone(4), connect clone(1) to them
3. Process node 2: create clone(3), connect clone(2) to clone(1), clone(3)
4. Process node 4: connect clone(4) to clone(1), clone(3)
5. Process node 3: connect clone(3) to clone(2), clone(4)

Final cloned graph has same structure as original.
```

## Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **V**: Number of vertices (nodes)
- **E**: Number of edges (neighbor relationships)
- **Traversal**: Visit each node and edge exactly once
- **Cloning**: O(1) per node creation

### **Space Complexity:** O(V)
- **Visited map**: O(V) - stores mapping from original to cloned nodes
- **Queue (BFS)**: O(V) - maximum nodes in queue
- **Recursion stack (DFS)**: O(V) - maximum recursion depth
- **Cloned graph**: O(V + E) - not counted in auxiliary space

## Key Points

1. **Deep copy**: Create new nodes, not copy references
2. **Cycle handling**: Use visited map to prevent infinite loops
3. **Node mapping**: Track original → cloned node relationships
4. **Graph traversal**: BFS or DFS both work effectively
5. **Edge cases**: Handle null input and single node graphs

## Comparison: BFS vs DFS

| Aspect | BFS | DFS |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Approach** | Iterative | Recursive |
| **Space** | Queue + Map | Recursion Stack + Map |
| **Code** | More verbose | More concise |
| **Stack overflow** | No risk | Risk with deep graphs |
| **Performance** | Similar | Similar |

## Alternative Approaches

### **DFS Iterative (Stack)**
```python
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node:
            return None
        visited = {}
        stk = [node]
        visited[node] = Node(node.val)
        
        while stk:
            curr = stk.pop()
            
            for neighbor in curr.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val)
                    stk.append(neighbor)
                visited[curr].neighbors.append(visited[neighbor])
        
        return visited[node]
```
