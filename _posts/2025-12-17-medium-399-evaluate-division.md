# [Medium] 399. Evaluate Division

You are given an array of variable pairs `equations` and an array of real numbers `values`, where `equations[i] = [Ai, Bi]` and `values[i]` represent the equation `Ai / Bi = values[i]`. Each `Ai` or `Bi` is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some `queries`, where `queries[j] = [Cj, Dj]` represents the `jth` query where you must find the answer for `Cj / Dj = ?`.

Return *the answers to all queries*. If a single answer cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

**Note:** The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: 
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
Return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= equations.length <= 20`
- `equations[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= Ai.length, Bi.length <= 5`
- `values.length == equations.length`
- `0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 20`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5`
- `Ai, Bi, Cj, Dj` consist of lower case English letters and digits.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Division representation**: How are divisions represented? (Assumption: equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] means Ai / Bi = values[i])

2. **Query format**: What are we querying? (Assumption: queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] means find Cj / Dj)

3. **Unknown variables**: What if variables are unknown? (Assumption: Return -1.0 - cannot determine the division)

4. **Return format**: What should we return? (Assumption: Array of doubles - results for each query)

5. **Transitivity**: Are divisions transitive? (Assumption: Yes - if a/b = x and b/c = y, then a/c = x*y)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

For each query, try to find a direct path from numerator to denominator using the given equations. Use DFS or BFS to explore all possible paths, multiplying values along the path. If no path exists, return -1. This approach works but may explore many paths inefficiently, especially if the graph is large or queries are repeated.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Build a graph where nodes are variables and edges are division relationships with weights. For each query, use DFS or BFS to find a path from source to target, accumulating the product of edge weights. Cache results for repeated queries. This improves efficiency but still requires path finding for each query, which can be O(V + E) per query.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use Union-Find with weighted edges. For each equation a/b = value, union a and b while maintaining weights. Store weight[a] = value of a relative to its root. When querying a/b, if they're in the same component, calculate (weight[a] / root) / (weight[b] / root) = a/b. This achieves O((E + Q) × α(V)) time where α is inverse Ackermann (effectively constant). Alternatively, use graph DFS with memoization. The key insight is that Union-Find naturally handles transitivity and provides O(1) amortized queries after preprocessing, making it optimal for multiple queries.

## Solution 1: Union-Find with Weighted Edges (Recommended)

**Time Complexity:** O((E + Q) × α(n)) where E = equations, Q = queries, n = variables  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - For the union-find structure

This solution uses Union-Find with path compression and union by weight to maintain ratios between variables.

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parent = {}
        self.weight = {}

    def find(self, x):
        if x not in self.parent:
            self.parent[x] = x
            self.weight[x] = 1.0
            return x

        if self.parent[x] != x:
            orig_parent = self.parent[x]
            root = self.find(orig_parent)

            self.weight[x] *= self.weight[orig_parent]
            self.parent[x] = root

        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, a, b, value):
        if a not in self.parent:
            self.parent[a] = a
            self.weight[a] = 1.0
        if b not in self.parent:
            self.parent[b] = b
            self.weight[b] = 1.0

        rootA = self.find(a)
        rootB = self.find(b)

        if rootA != rootB:
            self.parent[rootA] = rootB
            self.weight[rootA] = value * self.weight[b] / self.weight[a]

    def calcEquation(self, equations, values, queries):
        for (a, b), val in zip(equations, values):
            self.union(a, b, val)

        res = []

        for a, b in queries:
            if a not in self.parent or b not in self.parent:
                res.append(-1.0)
                continue

            rootA = self.find(a)
            rootB = self.find(b)

            if rootA != rootB:
                res.append(-1.0)
            else:
                res.append(self.weight[a] / self.weight[b])

        return res
```

### How Solution 1 Works

1. **Union-Find Structure**:
   - `weights[node] = {parent, weight}` where `weight = node / parent`
   - Example: If `a / b = 2.0`, then `weights[a] = {b, 2.0}`

2. **Find with Path Compression**:
   - Finds root and compresses path
   - Updates weight along path: `node_weight = node_weight × parent_weight`
   - Returns `{root, node_weight}`

3. **Union Operation**:
   - Connects two components with a ratio
   - If `a / b = value`, connects roots with appropriate weight
   - Weight formula: `root_weight = (divisor_weight × value) / dividend_weight`

4. **Query Processing**:
   - If both variables exist and have same root, return `dividend_weight / divisor_weight`
   - Otherwise return `-1.0`

### Key Insight

The Union-Find structure maintains ratios relative to the root:
- `weights[node] = {root, node/root}`
- To find `a / b`: If both have same root, `(a/root) / (b/root) = a/b`

## Solution 2: Graph DFS

**Time Complexity:** O(E + Q × V) where V = number of variables  
**Space Complexity:** O(E + V) - For graph and visited set

Build a graph and use DFS to find paths between variables.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def calcEquation(self, equations, values, queries):
        graph = defaultdict(list)

        # Build graph
        for (a, b), val in zip(equations, values):
            graph[a].append((b, val))
            graph[b].append((a, 1.0 / val))

        def dfs(curr, target, visited, product):
            if curr == target:
                return product

            visited.add(curr)

            for neighbor, weight in graph[curr]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    res = dfs(neighbor, target, visited, product * weight)
                    if res != -1.0:
                        return res

            return -1.0

        result = []

        for start, end in queries:
            if start not in graph or end not in graph:
                result.append(-1.0)
                continue

            visited = set()
            result.append(dfs(start, end, visited, 1.0))

        return result

```

### How Solution 2 Works

1. **Build Bidirectional Graph**:
   - For `a / b = value`, add edges: `a → b` with weight `value`, `b → a` with weight `1/value`

2. **DFS Search**:
   - Start from dividend, search for divisor
   - Multiply weights along path
   - Return product when target found

3. **Backtracking**:
   - Use visited set to avoid cycles
   - Remove from visited when backtracking

## Comparison of Approaches

| Aspect | Union-Find | Graph DFS |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Time Complexity** | O((E+Q)×α(n)) | O(E + Q×V) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(n) | O(E + V) |
| **Query Time** | O(α(n)) | O(V) |
| **Code Complexity** | Moderate | Simple |
| **Best For** | Many queries | Few queries |

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"]]`

### Solution 1 (Union-Find):

```
Step 1: Process "a / b = 2.0"
  unite(a, b, 2.0):
    find(a) → {a, 1.0}
    find(b) → {b, 1.0}
    weights[a] = {b, 2.0}

Step 2: Process "b / c = 3.0"
  unite(b, c, 3.0):
    find(b) → {b, 1.0}
    find(c) → {c, 1.0}
    weights[b] = {c, 3.0}

Step 3: Query "a / c = ?"
  find(a) → find(b) → {c, 1.0}
    Path: a → b → c
    weights[a] = {b, 2.0}
    find(b) → {c, 3.0}
    weights[a] = {c, 2.0 × 3.0 = 6.0}
  
  find(c) → {c, 1.0}
  
  Result: 6.0 / 1.0 = 6.0
```

### Solution 2 (Graph DFS):

```
Graph:
  a → [(b, 2.0)]
  b → [(a, 0.5), (c, 3.0)]
  c → [(b, 0.333)]

Query "a / c":
  DFS(a, c):
    a → b (product = 2.0)
    b → c (product = 2.0 × 3.0 = 6.0)
    Found! Return 6.0
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Solution | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Union-Find | O((E+Q)×α(n)) | O(n) | Optimal for many queries |
| Graph DFS | O(E + Q×V) | O(E+V) | Simple, good for few queries |

## Edge Cases

1. **Variable not in equations**: Return `-1.0`
2. **Same variable query**: `a / a = 1.0`
3. **Disconnected components**: Variables in different components return `-1.0`
4. **Single equation**: Handle minimal input
5. **Transitive relationships**: `a/b=2, b/c=3` → `a/c=6`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Path compression**: Not updating weights during path compression
2. **Union weight calculation**: Wrong formula for connecting roots
3. **Division by zero**: Should not occur per problem constraints
4. **Missing variables**: Not checking if variables exist before querying

## Key Insights

1. **Weighted Union-Find**: Maintains ratios relative to root
2. **Path compression**: Updates weights along path for efficiency
3. **Union by weight**: Connects roots with correct ratio
4. **Query formula**: `dividend_weight / divisor_weight` when same root

## Optimization Tips

1. **Path compression**: Essential for O(α(n)) amortized time
2. **Lazy initialization**: Only create entries when needed
3. **Early termination**: Check if variables exist before processing
