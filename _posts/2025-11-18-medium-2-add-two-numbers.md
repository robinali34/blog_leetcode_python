# [Medium] 2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
Explanation: 9999999 + 9999 = 10009998
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Number representation**: How are numbers represented? (Assumption: Each node contains a single digit, most significant digit is head, least significant is tail - reverse order)

2. **Carry handling**: How should we handle carry? (Assumption: If sum of two digits >= 10, carry 1 to next position)

3. **Different lengths**: What if lists have different lengths? (Assumption: Treat missing digits as 0 - pad shorter list with zeros)

4. **Leading zeros**: Can result have leading zeros? (Assumption: No - per constraints, no leading zeros in input, result shouldn't have them either)

5. **Return format**: Should we return a new list or modify existing? (Assumption: Return new linked list - don't modify input lists)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to add two numbers represented as linked lists. Let me convert them to integers first."

**Naive Solution**: Convert both linked lists to integers, add them, then convert result back to linked list.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(1) space (but may overflow)

**Issues**:
- Integer overflow for large numbers (lists can be up to 100 nodes)
- Doesn't work for very large numbers
- Not the intended approach for linked list manipulation
- Loses the linked list structure advantage

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "I should process digits one by one, maintaining carry. This avoids overflow and works with linked lists naturally."

**Improved Solution**: Traverse both lists simultaneously, add corresponding digits along with carry. Create new nodes for result. Handle different list lengths by treating missing digits as 0.

**Complexity**: O(max(m, n)) time, O(max(m, n)) space

**Improvements**:
- No integer overflow issues
- Works with linked list structure
- Handles different lengths naturally
- Processes digits in correct order

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "The digit-by-digit approach is optimal. Let me refine it to handle edge cases and consider recursive alternative."

**Best Solution**: Iterative digit-by-digit addition with carry propagation. Can also use recursive approach for elegance, but iterative is more space-efficient.

**Key Realizations**:
1. Digit-by-digit addition is the correct approach
2. Carry propagation is straightforward
3. O(max(m, n)) time and space is optimal
4. Both iterative and recursive approaches work well

## Solution: Recursive Approach

**Time Complexity:** O(max(m, n)) where m and n are the lengths of l1 and l2  
**Space Complexity:** O(max(m, n)) due to recursion stack

This solution uses a recursive helper function that processes both lists simultaneously, handling carry propagation naturally through the recursion.

### Solution: Recursive Helper

```python
/
 Definition for singly-linked list.
 struct ListNode :
     val
     ListNode next
     ListNode() : val(0), next(None) :
     ListNode(x) : val(x), next(None) :
     ListNode(x, ListNode next) : val(x), next(next) :
/
class Solution:
def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
    return addTwoNumbersHelper(l1, l2, 0)
def addTwoNumbersHelper(self, l1, l2, carry):
    // Base case: if both lists are null and no carry
    if l1 == None  and  l2 == None  and  carry == 0:
        return None
    sum = carry
    if l1 != None:
        sum += l1.val
    if l2 != None:
        sum += l2.val
    ListNode newNode = ListNode(sum % 10)
    newNode.next = addTwoNumbersHelper(
    (l1.next if             l1 != None  else None,)
    (l2.next if             l2 != None  else None,)
    sum / 10
    )
    return newNode
```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Step-by-Step Example: `l1 = [2,4,3]`, `l2 = [5,6,4]`

```
Initial Call: addTwoNumbersHelper([2,4,3], [5,6,4], 0)

Step 1: Process first digits
  sum = 0 + 2 + 5 = 7
  newNode = ListNode(7 % 10) = ListNode(7)
  carry = 7 / 10 = 0
  Recursive call: addTwoNumbersHelper([4,3], [6,4], 0)

Step 2: Process second digits
  sum = 0 + 4 + 6 = 10
  newNode = ListNode(10 % 10) = ListNode(0)
  carry = 10 / 10 = 1
  Recursive call: addTwoNumbersHelper([3], [4], 1)

Step 3: Process third digits
  sum = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8
  newNode = ListNode(8 % 10) = ListNode(8)
  carry = 8 / 10 = 0
  Recursive call: addTwoNumbersHelper(null, null, 0)

Step 4: Base case reached
  l1 == null && l2 == null && carry == 0 → return null

Result: [7] -> [0] -> [8] -> null
```

### Visual Representation

```
l1:  2 -> 4 -> 3 -> null  (represents 342)
l2:  5 -> 6 -> 4 -> null  (represents 465)
     ↓    ↓    ↓
     7    0    8
     ↓    ↓    ↓
Result: 7 -> 0 -> 8 -> null  (represents 807)

Calculation: 342 + 465 = 807
```

### Example with Carry: `l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9]`, `l2 = [9,9,9,9]`

```
Step 1: 9 + 9 + 0 = 18 → digit=8, carry=1
Step 2: 9 + 9 + 1 = 19 → digit=9, carry=1
Step 3: 9 + 9 + 1 = 19 → digit=9, carry=1
Step 4: 9 + 9 + 1 = 19 → digit=9, carry=1
Step 5: 9 + 0 + 1 = 10 → digit=0, carry=1
Step 6: 9 + 0 + 1 = 10 → digit=0, carry=1
Step 7: 9 + 0 + 1 = 10 → digit=0, carry=1
Step 8: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 → digit=1, carry=0

Result: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

## Key Insights

1. **Recursive Structure**: Each recursive call processes one digit from each list
2. **Carry Propagation**: Carry is passed down through recursive calls and handled at each level
3. **Unequal Length Handling**: When one list ends, treat missing digits as 0
4. **Base Case**: Stop when both lists are null AND carry is 0
5. **Reverse Order**: Since digits are stored in reverse, we process from least significant to most significant

## Algorithm Breakdown

```python
def addTwoNumbersHelper(self, l1, l2, carry):
    // Base case: all digits processed and no carry
    if l1 == None  and  l2 == None  and  carry == 0:
        return None
    // Calculate sum: carry + l1.val + l2.val
    sum = carry
    if (l1 != None) sum += l1.val
    if (l2 != None) sum += l2.val
    // Create new node with ones digit
    ListNode newNode = ListNode(sum % 10)
    // Recursively process next digits
    newNode.next = addTwoNumbersHelper(
    (l1.next if         l1 != None  else None,  // Move to next or null)
    (l2.next if         l2 != None  else None,  // Move to next or null)
    sum / 10                              // Pass carry forward
    )
    return newNode
```

## Edge Cases

1. **Equal length lists**: `[2,4,3] + [5,6,4]` → `[7,0,8]`
2. **Different length lists**: `[9,9,9,9] + [9,9]` → `[8,9,0,0,1]`
3. **Carry at end**: `[9,9] + [1]` → `[0,0,1]`
4. **Single digits**: `[5] + [5]` → `[0,1]`
5. **Zero inputs**: `[0] + [0]` → `[0]`
6. **One list longer**: `[1] + [9,9,9]` → `[0,0,0,1]`

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 2: Iterative with Dummy Node

**Time Complexity:** O(max(m, n))  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) excluding output space

```python
class Solution:
def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
    def dummy(self, 0)
    ListNode curr = dummy
    carry = 0
    while l1 != None  or  l2 != None  or  carry > 0:
        if l1 != None:
            carry += l1.val
            l1 = l1.next
        if l2 != None:
            carry += l2.val
            l2 = l2.next
        curr.next = ListNode(carry % 10)
        carry /= 10
        curr = curr.next
    return dummy.next
```

**Pros:**
- O(1) space complexity (no recursion stack)
- More efficient for long lists
- Easier to understand for some developers

**Cons:**
- Requires dummy node
- More verbose

### Approach 3: Iterative Without Dummy Node

**Time Complexity:** O(max(m, n))  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) excluding output space

```python
class Solution:
def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
    if (l1 == None) return l2
    if (l2 == None) return l1
    ListNode head = None
    ListNode tail = None
    carry = 0
    while l1 != None  or  l2 != None  or  carry > 0:
        sum = carry
        if l1 != None:
            sum += l1.val
            l1 = l1.next
        if l2 != None:
            sum += l2.val
            l2 = l2.next
        ListNode newNode = ListNode(sum % 10)
        if head == None:
            head = tail = newNode
             else :
            tail.next = newNode
            tail = newNode
        carry = sum / 10
    return head
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Recursive** | O(max(m,n)) | O(max(m,n)) | Elegant, natural carry handling | Stack overflow risk, O(n) space |
| **Iterative (Dummy)** | O(max(m,n)) | O(1) | Space efficient, clean code | Requires dummy node |
| **Iterative (No Dummy)** | O(max(m,n)) | O(1) | Space efficient | More edge case handling |

## Implementation Details

### Recursive Base Case

```python
if l1 == None  and  l2 == None  and  carry == 0:
    return None
```

**Why all three conditions?**
- `l1 == nullptr && l2 == nullptr`: Both lists exhausted
- `carry == 0`: No remaining carry to propagate
- If carry > 0, we need to create one more node

### Digit Extraction

```python
sum = carry
if (l1 != None) sum += l1.val
if (l2 != None) sum += l2.val
digit = sum % 10  // Ones digit
newCarry = sum / 10  // Tens digit (carry)
```

### Null Handling

```python
(l1.next if l1 != None  else None)
```

When a list ends, we pass `nullptr` to indicate no more digits from that list.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting final carry**: Not handling carry after both lists end
2. **Wrong base case**: Returning too early when carry > 0
3. **Null pointer dereference**: Accessing `l1->val` when `l1` is null
4. **Wrong digit calculation**: Using `sum / 10` instead of `sum % 10` for digit
5. **Memory leaks**: Not properly managing dynamically allocated nodes

## Optimization Tips

1. **Iterative Preferred**: For production code, use iterative approach to avoid stack overflow
2. **Dummy Node**: Simplifies code by avoiding special cases for head
3. **Early Termination**: Can optimize by checking if both lists are null and carry is 0
4. **In-place Modification**: Could modify one list in-place to save space (not recommended)

## Recursive vs Iterative

### When to Use Recursive

- **Pros**: 
  - More elegant and concise
  - Natural carry propagation
  - Easier to reason about
  
- **Cons**:
  - O(n) space for recursion stack
  - Risk of stack overflow for very long lists
  - Slightly slower due to function call overhead

### When to Use Iterative

- **Pros**:
  - O(1) space complexity
  - No stack overflow risk
  - Better performance
  
- **Cons**:
  - More verbose code
  - Requires careful pointer management

**Recommendation**: Use iterative approach for production code, recursive for interviews/learning.
