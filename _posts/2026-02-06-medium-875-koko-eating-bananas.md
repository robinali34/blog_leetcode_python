# [Medium] 875. Koko Eating Bananas

## Problem Statement

Koko has `n` piles of bananas; the `i`-th pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards return in `h` hours. Koko can choose an integer eating speed `k` (bananas per hour). Each hour she picks one pile and eats `k` bananas from it; if the pile has fewer than `k`, she eats all of them and does not eat from another pile that hour. Return the **minimum** integer `k` such that she can finish all bananas within `h` hours.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: At speed 4: (3/4 + 6/4 + 7/4 + 11/4) = 1+2+2+3 = 8 hours.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
Explanation: She must finish in 5 hours, so speed must be at least max(piles) = 30.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
- `piles.length <= h <= 10^9`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution Approach

- **Feasibility:** For speed `k`, hours needed = sum over piles of `ceil(pile / k)` = `pile / k` if divisible, else `pile / k + 1`. In code: `pile / k + (pile % k != 0)`.
- **Minimize k:** We want the smallest `k` such that total hours ≤ `h`. Speed is in range `[1, max(piles)]`.
- **Brute force:** Try `k = 1, 2, 3, ...` until feasible. Too slow when `max(piles)` is large.
- **Optimized:** Binary search on `k` in `[1, max(piles)]`. For each `mid`, compute hours; if `hours <= h` then `mid` is feasible, so search left (right = mid), else search right (left = mid + 1). Return the smallest feasible `k` (the leftmost that works).

## Solution 1: Linear Search (Brute Force)

Try speed 1, 2, 3, ... until total hours ≤ h.

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles, h):
        speed = 1
        
        while True:
            hourSpend = 0
            
            for pile in piles:
                hourSpend += pile // speed + (1 if pile % speed != 0 else 0)
                
                if hourSpend > h:
                    break
            
            if hourSpend <= h:
                return speed
            else:
                speed += 1
```

- **Time:** O(n × max(piles)) in the worst case — too slow for large piles.
- **Space:** O(1).

## Solution 2: Binary Search on Answer

Binary search on `k` in `[1, max(piles)]`; for each `mid`, compute total hours and narrow the range.

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles, h):
        left = 1
        right = max(piles)
        
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            
            hourSpend = 0
            for pile in piles:
                hourSpend += pile // mid + (1 if pile % mid != 0 else 0)
            
            if hourSpend <= h:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        
        return right
```

- **Invariant:** `right` is always feasible; we look for the smallest feasible `k`, which is `right` when `left == right`.
- **Time:** O(n log(max(piles))). **Space:** O(1).

## Key Insights

1. **Binary search on the answer:** When the answer is in a range and feasibility is easy to check, binary search on that range.
2. **Ceiling division:** `pile / k + (pile % k != 0)` or `(pile + k - 1) / k` gives hours per pile.
3. **Range:** Minimum speed is 1; maximum needed is `max(piles)` (one hour per pile).
