# [Medium] 983. Minimum Cost For Tickets

You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array `days`. Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in **three different ways**:

- a **1-day** pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars,
- a **7-day** pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars, and
- a **30-day** pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

- For example, if we get a **7-day** pass on day `2`, then we can travel for `7` days: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, and `8`.

Return *the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 4, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= days.length <= 365`
- `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
- `days` is in strictly increasing order.
- `costs.length == 3`
- `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Ticket types**: What ticket types are available? (Assumption: 1-day pass (costs[0]), 7-day pass (costs[1]), 30-day pass (costs[2]))

2. **Travel days**: What are travel days? (Assumption: Array of days when we need to travel - days[i] is the day number)

3. **Optimization goal**: What are we optimizing for? (Assumption: Minimum cost to cover all travel days)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - minimum cost to cover all travel days)

5. **Ticket validity**: How long are tickets valid? (Assumption: 1-day pass covers 1 day, 7-day pass covers 30 consecutive days, 30-day pass covers 30 consecutive days)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Try all possible combinations of ticket purchases. For each travel day, decide which ticket to buy (1-day, 7-day, or 30-day), considering which future days are covered. Use recursive exploration without memoization. This approach has exponential time complexity as we explore all combinations, which is infeasible for many travel days.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming with memoization. For each day, try buying each ticket type and recursively solve for remaining uncovered days. Memoize results to avoid recomputation. However, the state space can be large if we track which days are covered. Alternatively, use dp[day] = minimum cost to cover all travel days from day onwards, but need to handle ticket validity periods carefully.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming where dp[i] = minimum cost to cover all travel days from days[i] onwards. For each travel day, try buying each ticket type: 1-day covers days[i], 7-day covers next 7 days, 30-day covers next 30 days. Find the next uncovered travel day after ticket expires, and use dp[next_uncovered]. This achieves O(n) time where n is the number of travel days, as we process each day once. The key insight is that we only need to consider travel days (not all calendar days), and we can use binary search or linear scan to find the next uncovered day efficiently.

## Solution: Dynamic Programming

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the last travel day (at most 365)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

The key insight is to use dynamic programming to track the minimum cost to travel up to each day. For each day, we consider three options: buying a 1-day, 7-day, or 30-day pass.

### Solution: Bottom-Up DP (Optimized)

```python
class Solution:
def mincostTickets(self, days, costs):
    lastDay = days[-1]
    list[int> dp(lastDay + 1, 0)
    set[int> travelDays(days.begin(), days.end())
    for (i = 1 i <= lastDay i += 1) :
    if travelDays.find(i) == travelDays.end():
        # Not a travel day - cost stays the same as previous day
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
         else :
        # Travel day - choose minimum cost among three options
        dp[i] = min(:
        dp[i - 1] + costs[0],           # Buy 1-day pass
        dp[max(0, i - 7)] + costs[1],   # Buy 7-day pass
        dp[max(0, i - 30)] + costs[2]   # Buy 30-day pass
        )
return dp[lastDay]

```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Key Insight: DP State Definition

**DP State:** `dp[i]` = minimum cost to travel up to day `i`

**Transition:**
- If day `i` is **not** a travel day: `dp[i] = dp[i-1]` (no cost)
- If day `i` **is** a travel day: choose minimum of:
  - Buy 1-day pass: `dp[i-1] + costs[0]`
  - Buy 7-day pass: `dp[i-7] + costs[1]` (covers days i-6 to i)
  - Buy 30-day pass: `dp[i-30] + costs[2]` (covers days i-29 to i)

### Step-by-Step Example: `days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]`

```
Travel days: {1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 20}
Last day: 20

Day-by-day DP:
Day 0: dp[0] = 0 (base case)

Day 1: Travel day
  - Option 1: dp[0] + costs[0] = 0 + 2 = 2
  - Option 2: dp[max(0,1-7)] + costs[1] = dp[0] + 7 = 7
  - Option 3: dp[max(0,1-30)] + costs[2] = dp[0] + 15 = 15
  dp[1] = min(2, 7, 15) = 2

Day 2: Not a travel day
  dp[2] = dp[1] = 2

Day 3: Not a travel day
  dp[3] = dp[2] = 2

Day 4: Travel day
  - Option 1: dp[3] + costs[0] = 2 + 2 = 4
  - Option 2: dp[max(0,4-7)] + costs[1] = dp[0] + 7 = 7
  - Option 3: dp[max(0,4-30)] + costs[2] = dp[0] + 15 = 15
  dp[4] = min(4, 7, 15) = 4

Day 5: Not a travel day
  dp[5] = dp[4] = 4

Day 6: Travel day
  - Option 1: dp[5] + costs[0] = 4 + 2 = 6
  - Option 2: dp[max(0,6-7)] + costs[1] = dp[0] + 7 = 7
  - Option 3: dp[max(0,6-30)] + costs[2] = dp[0] + 15 = 15
  dp[6] = min(6, 7, 15) = 6

Day 7: Travel day
  - Option 1: dp[6] + costs[0] = 6 + 2 = 8
  - Option 2: dp[max(0,7-7)] + costs[1] = dp[0] + 7 = 7
  - Option 3: dp[max(0,7-30)] + costs[2] = dp[0] + 15 = 15
  dp[7] = min(8, 7, 15) = 7

Day 8: Travel day
  - Option 1: dp[7] + costs[0] = 7 + 2 = 9
  - Option 2: dp[max(0,8-7)] + costs[1] = dp[1] + 7 = 2 + 7 = 9
  - Option 3: dp[max(0,8-30)] + costs[2] = dp[0] + 15 = 15
  dp[8] = min(9, 9, 15) = 9

Days 9-19: Not travel days
  dp[9] = dp[10] = ... = dp[19] = 9

Day 20: Travel day
  - Option 1: dp[19] + costs[0] = 9 + 2 = 11
  - Option 2: dp[max(0,20-7)] + costs[1] = dp[13] + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
  - Option 3: dp[max(0,20-30)] + costs[2] = dp[0] + 15 = 15
  dp[20] = min(11, 16, 15) = 11

Final answer: dp[20] = 11
```

**Visual Representation:**
```
Days:    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
Travel:      ✓        ✓     ✓  ✓  ✓
DP:      0  2  2  2  4  4  6  7  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9 11

Optimal strategy:
- Day 1: Buy 1-day pass ($2)
- Day 4: Buy 7-day pass ($7) - covers days 4-10
- Day 20: Buy 1-day pass ($2)
Total: $11
```

## Key Insights

1. **DP State**: Track minimum cost up to each day
2. **Non-Travel Days**: Cost doesn't increase (no ticket needed)
3. **Travel Days**: Choose minimum among three pass options
4. **Pass Coverage**: 7-day pass covers 7 consecutive days, 30-day covers 30
5. **Boundary Handling**: Use `max(0, i-duration)` to handle early days

## Algorithm Breakdown

### Initialization

```python
lastDay = days[-1]
list[int> dp(lastDay + 1, 0)
set[int> travelDays(days.begin(), days.end())

```

**Why:**
- `lastDay`: Only need to compute up to the last travel day
- `dp`: Array to store minimum cost for each day
- `travelDays`: Set for O(1) lookup of travel days

### Main DP Loop

```python
for (i = 1 i <= lastDay i += 1) :
if travelDays.find(i) == travelDays.end():
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
     else :
    dp[i] = min(:
    dp[i - 1] + costs[0],
    dp[max(0, i - 7)] + costs[1],
    dp[max(0, i - 30)] + costs[2]
    )

```

**Why:**
- **Non-travel day**: No cost, so cost equals previous day
- **Travel day**: Choose cheapest option among three passes
- **max(0, i-duration)**: Prevents negative indices

## Edge Cases

1. **Single travel day**: Buy 1-day pass
2. **Consecutive travel days**: 7-day or 30-day pass might be cheaper
3. **Sparse travel days**: 1-day passes might be optimal
4. **Dense travel days**: 30-day pass likely optimal
5. **Early days**: `max(0, i-duration)` handles days < 7 or < 30

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 2: Top-Down DP with Memoization

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

```python
class Solution:
list[int> days, costs, memo
durations[3] = :1, 7, 30
def dp(self, i):
    if (i >= len(days)) return 0
    if (memo[i] != -1) return memo[i]
    memo[i] = INT_MAX
    for (k = 0 k < 3 k += 1) :
    # Find first day after current pass expires
    j = upper_bound(days.begin(), days.end(),
    days[i] + durations[k] - 1) - days.begin()
    memo[i] = min(memo[i], dp(j) + costs[k])
return memo[i]
def mincostTickets(self, days, costs):
    this.days = days
    this.costs = costs
    memo.assign(len(days), -1)
    return dp(0)

```

**Pros:**
- Only processes travel days (more efficient for sparse schedules)
- Natural recursive structure

**Cons:**
- More complex with `upper_bound`
- Recursion overhead

### Approach 3: Day-by-Day DP (Current Solution)

**Pros:**
- Simple and intuitive
- Easy to understand
- No recursion overhead
- O(1) lookup with set

**Cons:**
- Processes all days up to last_day (but max 365 days)

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Bottom-Up DP** | O(n) | O(n) | Simple, intuitive | Processes all days |
| **Top-Down DP** | O(m) | O(m) | Only travel days | More complex |

Where `n` = last travel day (≤365), `m` = number of travel days

## Implementation Details

### Why Use `max(0, i - duration)`?

**Example:** On day 5, buying a 7-day pass:
- Pass covers days 5-11
- Cost = `dp[5-7] + costs[1]` = `dp[-2] + costs[1]` ❌
- Use `max(0, 5-7)` = `dp[0] + costs[1]` ✓

**Why:** Days before day 1 don't exist, so use base case `dp[0] = 0`.

### Pass Coverage

**7-day pass bought on day `i`:**
- Covers days: `i, i+1, ..., i+6`
- Expires after day `i+6`
- Next cost starts from day `i+7`

**30-day pass bought on day `i`:**
- Covers days: `i, i+1, ..., i+29`
- Expires after day `i+29`
- Next cost starts from day `i+30`

### Why Set for Travel Days?

```python
set[int> travelDays(days.begin(), days.end())

```

**Why:** O(1) lookup instead of O(m) linear search in `days` array.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting non-travel days**: Must set `dp[i] = dp[i-1]` for non-travel days
2. **Wrong pass coverage**: 7-day pass covers 7 days, not 6
3. **Negative indices**: Must use `max(0, i-duration)`
4. **Not considering all options**: Must compare all three pass types
5. **Base case**: `dp[0] = 0` (no cost before day 1)

## Optimization Tips

1. **Use set for O(1) lookup**: Faster than linear search
2. **Only iterate to last_day**: Don't need to go beyond
3. **Bottom-up DP**: Avoids recursion overhead
4. **Early termination**: Not applicable (need all days)

## Pattern Recognition

This problem demonstrates the **"Minimum Cost with Choices"** DP pattern:

```
1. Define state: dp[i] = minimum cost up to day i
2. For each state, consider all choices (1-day, 7-day, 30-day)
3. Take minimum among all choices
4. Handle non-travel days separately (no cost)
```

## Why Bottom-Up DP Works Best

**Advantages:**
- Simple and intuitive
- No recursion overhead
- Easy to understand and debug
- Efficient for this problem size (max 365 days)

**Top-Down Alternative:**
- More efficient for sparse schedules
- Only processes travel days
- But more complex with `upper_bound`

## Step-by-Step Trace: `days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]`

```
Travel days: {1-10, 30, 31}
Last day: 31

Key decisions:
Day 1: Buy 30-day pass ($15) - covers days 1-30
  - Cheaper than buying 10 individual 1-day passes ($20)
  - Cheaper than buying multiple 7-day passes

Day 31: Buy 1-day pass ($2) - covers day 31

DP progression:
dp[1] = min(2, 7, 15) = 2 (but we'll see 30-day is better)
...
dp[30] = 15 (30-day pass covers all days 1-30)
dp[31] = min(15+2, 15+7, 15+15) = 17

Actually, buying 30-day pass on day 1 covers days 1-30,
so dp[30] = 15, and dp[31] = 15 + 2 = 17
```

## Mathematical Insight

**Optimal Substructure:**
- To find minimum cost for days 1..i, we need minimum cost for days 1..(i-1), 1..(i-7), or 1..(i-30)
- Each subproblem is independent and optimal

**Greedy Doesn't Work:**
- Always buying cheapest pass per day doesn't work
- Example: 7-day pass might be cheaper than 7 individual 1-day passes
- Need to consider future days

## Why This Solution is Optimized

1. **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n ≤ 365 (linear)
2. **Space Complexity**: O(n) for DP array
3. **Lookup Efficiency**: O(1) with unordered_set
4. **Code Clarity**: Simple, readable bottom-up DP
5. **No Redundancy**: Processes each day exactly once
