# 44. Wildcard Matching

## Problem Statement

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'` where:

- `'?'` Matches any single character.
- `'*'` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "cb", p = "?a"
Output: false
Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "adceb", p = "*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: The first '*' matches the empty sequence, and the second '*' matches the substring "dce".
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: s = "acdcb", p = "a*c?b"
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'?'` or `'*'`.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Pattern matching scope**: Should the pattern match the entire string or just a substring? (Assumption: The pattern must match the entire input string, not just a substring)

2. **Wildcard behavior**: What does `'*'` match? (Assumption: `'*'` matches any sequence of characters, including the empty sequence - it can match zero or more characters)

3. **Single character match**: What does `'?'` match? (Assumption: `'?'` matches exactly one character - any single character)

4. **Multiple stars**: Can the pattern contain multiple `'*'` characters? (Assumption: Yes - multiple stars are allowed and each can match independently)

5. **Empty string**: What should we return for empty string and empty pattern? (Assumption: Empty pattern matches empty string only - return true if both are empty, false otherwise)

## Interview Deduction Process (30 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (8 minutes)**

Use recursion with backtracking. For each position, if pattern character is `'?'` or matches string character, advance both pointers. If pattern character is `'*'`, try matching zero, one, two, ... characters. This approach has exponential time complexity O(2^(m+n)) in worst case due to backtracking.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (10 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming with memoization. Create a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents whether `s[0..i-1]` matches `p[0..j-1]`. Handle three cases: exact match or `'?'`, `'*'` matching zero or more characters. This reduces time complexity to O(m*n) with O(m*n) space.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (12 minutes)**

Use a greedy two-pointer approach. When encountering `'*'`, record its position and the current string position. Try matching as few characters as possible with `'*'`, and if a mismatch occurs later, backtrack to the last `'*'` and let it match one more character. This achieves O(m*n) worst case but O(m+n) average case, with O(1) space complexity.

## Solution Approach

This problem is similar to regular expression matching but simpler. The key challenge is handling `'*'` which can match any sequence of characters.

### Key Insights:

1. **Greedy Matching**: For `'*'`, try matching as few characters as possible first
2. **Backtracking**: If a mismatch occurs after `'*'`, backtrack and let `'*'` match one more character
3. **Two Pointers**: Use two pointers to track current positions in string and pattern
4. **Star Tracking**: Keep track of the last `'*'` position and the string position after it

## Solution 1: Regex-Based Approach

```python
class Solution:
def isMatch(self, s, p):
    if not p) return s.empty(:
    str pat = "^"
    for c in p:
        if(c == '?') pat += '.'
        else if (c == '') pat += "."
        else pat += c
    pat.append('$')
    return regex_search(s, regex(pat))

```

### Algorithm Breakdown:

1. **Pattern Conversion**: Convert wildcard pattern to regex pattern
   - `'?'` → `'.'` (matches any single character in regex)
   - `'*'` → `".*"` (matches any sequence in regex)
   - Regular characters remain unchanged
2. **Anchoring**: Add `'^'` at start and `'$'` at end to ensure full string match
3. **Regex Search**: Use `regex_search` to check if the entire string matches the pattern

### Why This Works:

- **Regex Equivalence**: Wildcard matching is equivalent to regex matching with specific conversions
- **Full Match**: The `^` and `$` anchors ensure the pattern matches the entire string
- **Simple Implementation**: Leverages built-in regex functionality

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(m*n) - Regex matching typically has this complexity
- **Space Complexity**: O(m) - For the converted pattern string

## Solution 2: Two-Pointer Greedy Approach

```python
class Solution:
def isMatch(self, s, p):
    i = 0, j = 0
    lastStar = -1, matchAfterStar = -1
    M = len(s), N = len(p)
    while i < M:
        if j < N  and  (p[j] == s[i] * or  p[j] == '?'):
            i += 1
            j += 1
             else if(j < N  and  p[j] == '') :
            lastStar = j
            matchAfterStar = i
            j += 1
             else if(lastStar != -1) :
            j = lastStar + 1 # Reset pattern after ''
            matchAfterStar += 1 # let '' match one more character
            i = matchAfterStar
             else :
            # Mismatch with no previous ''
            return False
    while(j < N  and  p[j] == '') j += 1
    return j == N

```

## Solution 3: Recursion with Memoization

```python
class Solution:
def isMatch(self, s, p):
    m = len(s), n = len(p)
    list[list[int>> memo(m + 1, list[int>(n + 1, -1))
    return dfs(s, p, 0, 0, memo)
def dfs(self, s, p, i, j, memo):
    # Base cases
    if j == len(p):
        return i == len(s)
    if i == len(s):
        # If str is exhausted, pattern must be all '' to match
        for (k = j k < len(p) k += 1) :
        if (p[k] != '') return False
    return True
# Check memoization
if memo[i][j] != -1:
    return memo[i][j] == 1
bool result = False
if p[j] == '*':
    # '' can match zero or more characters
    # Option 1: Match zero characters (skip '')
    # Option 2: Match one or more characters (consume one character from str)
    result = dfs(s, p, i, j + 1, memo)  or       # Match zero
    dfs(s, p, i + 1, j, memo)       # Match one or more
     else if (p[j] == '?'  or  s[i] == p[j]) :
    # '?' matches any single character, or characters match
    result = dfs(s, p, i + 1, j + 1, memo)
     else :
    # Characters don't match
    result = False
(1 if         memo[i][j] = result  else 0)
return result

```

### Algorithm Breakdown:

1. **Memoization Table**: `memo[i][j]` stores whether `s[i..]` matches `p[j..]`
   - `-1`: Not computed yet
   - `0`: False (doesn't match)
   - `1`: True (matches)

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If pattern is exhausted: return true only if string is also exhausted
   - If string is exhausted: pattern must be all `'*'` to match (empty sequence)

3. **Recursive Cases**:
   - If `p[j] == '*'`: Try matching zero characters (skip `'*'`) or one or more characters (consume one from string)
   - If `p[j] == '?'` or `s[i] == p[j]`: Both pointers advance
   - Otherwise: Mismatch, return false

4. **Memoization**: Store and reuse computed results to avoid redundant calculations

### Why This Works:

- **Exhaustive Search**: Explores all possible ways `'*'` can match
- **Memoization**: Avoids recomputing the same subproblems
- **Clear Logic**: Recursive structure makes the matching logic explicit

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(m*n) - Each (i, j) pair is computed at most once
- **Space Complexity**: O(m*n) - For the memoization table and recursion stack

## Solution 4: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)

```python
class Solution:
def isMatch(self, s, p):
    m = len(s), n = len(p)
    list[list[bool>> dp(m + 1, list[bool>(n + 1, False))
    # Base case: empty str matches empty pattern
    dp[0][0] = True
    # Handle patterns starting with '' (can match empty str)
    for (j = 1 j <= n j += 1) :
    if p[j - 1] == '*':
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1]
# Fill the DP table
for (i = 1 i <= m i += 1) :
for (j = 1 j <= n j += 1) :
if p[j - 1] == '*':
    # '' can match zero or more characters
    # Option 1: Match zero characters (dp[i][j-1])
    # Option 2: Match one or more characters (dp[i-1][j])
    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] * or  dp[i - 1][j]
     else if (p[j - 1] == '?'  or  s[i - 1] == p[j - 1]) :
    # '?' matches any character, or characters match
    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
     else :
    # Characters don't match
    dp[i][j] = False
return dp[m][n]

```

### Algorithm Breakdown:

1. **DP State**: `dp[i][j]` represents whether `s[0..i-1]` matches `p[0..j-1]`

2. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[0][0] = true`: Empty string matches empty pattern
   - For `dp[0][j]`: Pattern starting with `'*'` can match empty string

3. **Transition**:
   - If `p[j-1] == '*'`: 
     - Match zero: `dp[i][j-1]` (skip `'*'`)
     - Match one or more: `dp[i-1][j]` (consume one character, keep `'*'`)
   - If `p[j-1] == '?'` or `s[i-1] == p[j-1]`: 
     - Both advance: `dp[i-1][j-1]`
   - Otherwise: `false`

4. **Result**: `dp[m][n]` indicates if entire string matches entire pattern

### Why This Works:

- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Builds solution from smaller subproblems
- **Systematic**: Processes all subproblems in order
- **Space Optimization Possible**: Can optimize to O(n) space since we only need previous row

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(m*n) - Fill a 2D table of size m×n
- **Space Complexity**: O(m*n) - For the DP table (can be optimized to O(n))

### Space-Optimized DP (O(n) space):

```python
class Solution:
def isMatch(self, s, p):
    m = len(s), n = len(p)
    list[bool> prev(n + 1, False)
    list[bool> curr(n + 1, False)
    # Base case: empty str matches empty pattern
    prev[0] = True
    # Handle patterns starting with ''
    for (j = 1 j <= n j += 1) :
    if p[j - 1] == '*':
        prev[j] = prev[j - 1]
# Fill the DP table
for (i = 1 i <= m i += 1) :
curr[0] = False # Non-empty str doesn't match empty pattern
for (j = 1 j <= n j += 1) :
if p[j - 1] == '*':
    curr[j] = curr[j - 1] * or  prev[j]
     else if (p[j - 1] == '?'  or  s[i - 1] == p[j - 1]) :
    curr[j] = prev[j - 1]
     else :
    curr[j] = False
prev = curr
return prev[n]

```

### Algorithm Breakdown:

1. **Two Pointers**: `i` tracks position in string `s`, `j` tracks position in pattern `p`
2. **Star Tracking**: 
   - `lastStar`: Position of the last `'*'` encountered
   - `matchAfterStar`: Position in string where we started matching after the last `'*'`
3. **Matching Logic**:
   - If characters match or pattern has `'?'`: advance both pointers
   - If pattern has `'*'`: record its position, try matching zero characters first (advance pattern pointer only)
   - If mismatch occurs: backtrack to last `'*'`, let it match one more character, and retry
4. **Final Check**: After processing all string characters, skip any remaining `'*'` in pattern and check if we've consumed the entire pattern

### Why This Works:

- **Greedy Strategy**: Try matching as few characters as possible with `'*'` first
- **Backtracking**: When a mismatch occurs, backtrack to the last `'*'` and expand its match
- **Efficient**: Avoids exponential backtracking by only backtracking to the last `'*'`

## Key Insights

1. **Greedy Strategy**: Try matching as few characters as possible with `'*'` first, then expand if needed
2. **Backtracking**: When a mismatch occurs, backtrack to the last `'*'` and let it match one more character
3. **Star Consolidation**: Multiple consecutive `'*'` can be treated as a single `'*'`
4. **Pattern Completion**: After processing the string, skip any remaining `'*'` and check if pattern is fully consumed
5. **Regex Alternative**: For simplicity, can convert wildcard pattern to regex pattern, though less efficient
6. **DP State Definition**: `dp[i][j]` = whether `s[0..i-1]` matches `p[0..j-1]`
7. **Star Matching**: `'*'` can match zero characters (`dp[i][j-1]`) or one or more characters (`dp[i-1][j]`)
8. **Memoization**: Recursive approach with memoization avoids recomputing the same subproblems
