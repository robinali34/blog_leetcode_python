# [Easy] 20. Valid Parentheses

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "([)]"
Output: false
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: s = "{[]}"
Output: true
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Valid parentheses definition**: What makes parentheses valid? (Assumption: Every opening bracket has matching closing bracket, properly nested - no cross-nesting)

2. **Bracket types**: What bracket types are there? (Assumption: Three types - '()', '[]', '{}' - each must match its own type)

3. **Nesting rules**: Can brackets be nested? (Assumption: Yes - but must be properly nested, e.g., "([])" is valid, "([)]" is not)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Boolean - true if valid, false otherwise)

5. **Empty string**: What if string is empty? (Assumption: Return true - empty string is valid)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to check if parentheses are valid. Let me think about counting opening and closing brackets."

**Naive Solution**: Count opening and closing brackets of each type. Check if counts match and if they're properly nested by scanning multiple times.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(1) space (but incorrect logic)

**Issues**:
- Simple counting doesn't handle nesting order correctly
- Can't distinguish between "([)]" (invalid) and "([])" (valid) with just counts
- Doesn't track the order of bracket types
- Fails for nested structures

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)
**Insight**: "I need to track the order of opening brackets. A stack can help maintain the order."

**Improved Solution**: Use a stack to track opening brackets. When encountering a closing bracket, check if it matches the most recent opening bracket. If stack is empty at the end, all brackets are matched.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- Correctly handles nesting order
- Tracks bracket type matching
- Single pass through string
- Handles all edge cases properly

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "The stack approach is already optimal. Let me verify edge cases and consider if we can optimize space."

**Best Solution**: Stack-based approach is optimal. Space can't be reduced below O(n) worst case (e.g., all opening brackets). Consider using a counter for single bracket type, but stack is needed for multiple types.

**Key Realizations**:
1. Stack is the natural data structure for matching problems
2. O(n) space is necessary for worst case
3. Single pass O(n) time is optimal
4. Stack approach handles all bracket types elegantly

## Solution: Stack-Based Matching

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Use a stack to track opening brackets. When encountering a closing bracket, check if it matches the most recent opening bracket. If stack is empty at the end, all brackets are matched.

```python
class Solution:
def isValid(self, s):
    list[char> st
    dict[char, char> map = {}
    :'', ':',
    :']', '[',
    :')', '('
for c in s:
    if c == '{'  or  c == '['  or  c == '(':
        st.push(c)
         else :
        if(not st  or  st.top() != map[c]) return False
        st.pop()
return not st

```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Key Insight: LIFO (Last In, First Out)

Parentheses must be closed in the reverse order they were opened. This matches the stack's LIFO property perfectly.

### Step-by-Step Example: `s = "([{}])"`

| Step | Char | Action | Stack | Valid? |
|------|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 0 | - | Initialize | [] | - |
| 1 | `(` | Push | `['(']` | - |
| 2 | `[` | Push | `['(', '[']` | - |
| 3 | `{` | Push | `['(', '[', '{']` | - |
| 4 | `}` | Pop: `{` matches | `['(', '[']` | Yes |
| 5 | `]` | Pop: `[` matches | `['(']` | Yes |
| 6 | `)` | Pop: `(` matches | `[]` | Yes |

**Final Check:** Stack is empty → `true`

### Step-by-Step Example: `s = "([)]"`

| Step | Char | Action | Stack | Valid? |
|------|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `(` | Push | `['(']` | - |
| 2 | `[` | Push | `['(', '[']` | - |
| 3 | `)` | Check: `(` matches | `['[']` | Yes |
| 4 | `]` | Check: `[` matches | `[]` | Yes |

Wait, that's incorrect. Let me recalculate:

| Step | Char | Action | Stack | Valid? |
|------|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `(` | Push | `['(']` | - |
| 2 | `[` | Push | `['(', '[']` | - |
| 3 | `)` | Check: top is `[`, not `(` | `['(', '[']` | **No** → Return false |

**Final Answer:** `false`

### Visual Representation

```
Valid: "([{}])"
        ( [ { } ] )
        ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑
        1 2 3 4 5 6
        
Stack progression:
1: ['(']
2: ['(', '[']
3: ['(', '[', '{']
4: ['(', '[']      (matched {})
5: ['(']           (matched [])
6: []              (matched ())
Result: true ✓

Invalid: "([)]"
          ( [ ) ]
          ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑
          1 2 3 4
          
Stack progression:
1: ['(']
2: ['(', '[']
3: ['(', '[']      (trying to match ) with [, fails!)
Result: false ✗
```

## Key Insights

1. **Stack for LIFO**: Opening brackets must close in reverse order
2. **Map for Matching**: Use hash map to map closing to opening brackets
3. **Empty Stack Check**: All brackets matched if stack is empty at end
4. **Early Return**: Return false immediately on mismatch or empty stack with closing bracket

## Algorithm Breakdown

### 1. Initialize Stack and Map
```python
list[char> st
dict[char, char> map = {}
:'', ':',
:']', '[',
:')', '('

```
- **Stack**: Stores opening brackets
- **Map**: Maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets

### 2. Process Opening Brackets
```python
if c == '{'  or  c == '['  or  c == '(':
    st.push(c)




```
- Push opening brackets onto stack
- They will be matched later when closing brackets appear

### 3. Process Closing Brackets
```python
else:
    if(not st  or  st.top() != map[c]) return False
    st.pop()

```
- **Check if stack is empty**: No opening bracket to match
- **Check if top matches**: Most recent opening bracket must match current closing bracket
- **Pop if matched**: Remove the matched opening bracket

### 4. Final Validation
```python
return not st




```
- If stack is empty, all brackets were matched
- If stack has remaining elements, some opening brackets were never closed

## Complexity Analysis

| Aspect | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| **Time** | O(n) - Single pass through string, each operation is O(1) |
| **Space** | O(n) - Stack can hold at most n/2 opening brackets in worst case |

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 1: Without Hash Map (Explicit Checks)

```python
def isValid(self, s):
    list[char> st
    for c in s:
        if c == '('  or  c == '['  or  c == '{':
            st.push(c)
             else :
            if(not st) return False
            char top = st.top()
            st.pop()
            if((c == ')'  and  top != '(')  or
            (c == ']'  and  top != '[')  or
            (c == ''  and  top != ':')) :
            return False
return not st

```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

### Approach 2: Using String as Stack

```python
def isValid(self, s):
    str stack = ""
    for c in s:
        if c == '('  or  c == '['  or  c == '{':
            stack += c
             else :
            if(not stack) return False
            char last = stack[-1]
            stack.pop()
            if((c == ')'  and  last != '(')  or
            (c == ']'  and  last != '[')  or
            (c == ''  and  last != ':')) :
            return False
return not stack

```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

**Note:** This is less efficient due to string operations, but uses less code.

### Approach 3: Counter-Based (Only for Single Type)

```python
# Only works for single bracket type like "()"
def isValid(self, s):
    count = 0
    for c in s:
        if(c == '(') count += 1
        else count -= 1
        if(count < 0) return False
    return count == 0

```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Limitation:** Doesn't work for multiple bracket types like `"([)]"`.

## Comparison of Approaches

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Stack + Map** | O(n) | O(n) | Clean, extensible | Slight overhead |
| **Stack + Explicit** | O(n) | O(n) | No map needed | More verbose |
| **String Stack** | O(n) | O(n) | Simple code | Less efficient |
| **Counter** | O(n) | O(1) | Space optimal | Only single type |

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty string**: `""` → `true` (valid by definition)
2. **Single bracket**: `"("` or `")"` → `false`
3. **Only opening**: `"((("` → `false`
4. **Only closing**: `")))"` → `false`
5. **Nested valid**: `"([{}])"` → `true`
6. **Interleaved invalid**: `"([)]"` → `false`
7. **Mixed valid**: `"()[]{}"` → `true`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not checking stack empty**: Forgetting to check `st.empty()` before `st.top()`
2. **Wrong map direction**: Mapping opening → closing instead of closing → opening
3. **Not returning false immediately**: Continuing after finding a mismatch
4. **Forgetting final check**: Not checking if stack is empty at the end
5. **Using wrong comparison**: Comparing `st.top() == c` instead of `st.top() == map[c]`

## Detailed Example Walkthrough

### Example 1: `s = "([{}])"`

```
Step 0: Initialize
  st = []
  map = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}

Step 1: c = '('
  Opening bracket → push
  st = ['(']

Step 2: c = '['
  Opening bracket → push
  st = ['(', '[']

Step 3: c = '{'
  Opening bracket → push
  st = ['(', '[', '{']

Step 4: c = '}'
  Closing bracket → check
  st.empty()? No
  st.top() = '{'
  map['}'] = '{'
  '{' == '{'? Yes → pop
  st = ['(', '[']

Step 5: c = ']'
  Closing bracket → check
  st.empty()? No
  st.top() = '['
  map[']'] = '['
  '[' == '['? Yes → pop
  st = ['(']

Step 6: c = ')'
  Closing bracket → check
  st.empty()? No
  st.top() = '('
  map[')'] = '('
  '(' == '('? Yes → pop
  st = []

Final: st.empty()? Yes → return true ✓
```

### Example 2: `s = "([)]"`

```
Step 0: Initialize
  st = []

Step 1: c = '('
  Opening bracket → push
  st = ['(']

Step 2: c = '['
  Opening bracket → push
  st = ['(', '[']

Step 3: c = ')'
  Closing bracket → check
  st.empty()? No
  st.top() = '['
  map[')'] = '('
  '[' == '('? No → return false ✗
```

## Why Stack Works

### LIFO Property

Parentheses matching requires **Last In, First Out**:
- Most recent opening bracket must match the next closing bracket
- Stack naturally provides LIFO behavior

### Example: `"([{}])"`

```
Opening order:  ( [ {
Closing order:    } ] )
                  ↑
              Must close in reverse order
```

### Counter Example: `"([)]"`

```
Opening order:  ( [
Closing order:    ) ]
                  ↑
              Wrong order! Can't close ')' before ']'
```

## Optimization Tips

### Early Exit
Already optimized - we return false immediately on mismatch.

### Memory Optimization
For very large strings, consider using a string as stack (if your use case allows) to potentially reduce allocations.

### Branch Prediction
The hash map lookup is very fast, but explicit checks might be slightly faster due to branch prediction:
```python
if c == ')':
    if(not st  or  st.top() != '(') return False
    st.pop()

```

- Use stack when you need to match elements in reverse order
- Perfect for nested structures (parentheses, brackets, tags)
- LIFO property naturally handles nested matching

**Key Insight:**
- Opening brackets → push
- Closing brackets → pop and verify match
- Stack empty at end → all matched

**Applications:**
- HTML/XML tag validation
- Expression evaluation
- Function call tracking

## Code Quality Notes

1. **Readability**: Hash map makes code clean and extensible
2. **Efficiency**: Optimal O(n) time and space
3. **Correctness**: Handles all edge cases properly
4. **Maintainability**: Easy to add new bracket types

## Extending to More Bracket Types

The solution easily extends to other bracket types:

```python
dict[char, char> map = {}
:'', ':',
:']', '[',
:')', '(',
:'>', '<'  # Add new type
# Check also includes '<'
if c == '{'  or  c == '['  or  c == '('  or  c == '<':
    st.push(c)

```
