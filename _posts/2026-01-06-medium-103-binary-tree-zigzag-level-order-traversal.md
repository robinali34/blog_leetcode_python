# 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values*. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
Explanation:
Level 0: [3] (left to right)
Level 1: [20,9] (right to left)
Level 2: [15,7] (left to right)
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Zigzag pattern**: What is the zigzag pattern? (Assumption: Level 0 left-to-right, level 1 right-to-left, level 2 left-to-right, alternating)

2. **Level definition**: How are levels numbered? (Assumption: Level 0 is root, level 1 is root's children, etc.)

3. **Output format**: How should we represent the result? (Assumption: List of lists - each inner list represents one level in zigzag order)

4. **Empty tree**: What should we return for an empty tree? (Assumption: Return empty list [])

5. **Starting direction**: Which direction should level 0 use? (Assumption: Left-to-right - even levels go left-to-right, odd levels go right-to-left)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Perform level-order traversal (BFS), collect all nodes level by level. Then reverse every other level (odd-indexed levels) to achieve zigzag order. This approach works but requires storing all levels and then reversing, which uses extra space and time.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use BFS with a flag to track direction: perform level-order traversal, but when adding nodes to the result for odd levels, insert them in reverse order or use a deque to add from the front. This avoids the need to reverse entire levels but requires careful handling of the direction flag.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use BFS with level tracking: perform standard BFS, but for each level, check if it's an odd level. If odd, reverse the level's nodes before adding to result. Alternatively, use a deque and add nodes from the front for odd levels. This achieves O(n) time (visit each node once) with O(n) space for the queue and result, which is optimal. The key insight is that we can achieve zigzag order by reversing the order of nodes at odd levels during BFS, without needing to modify the traversal itself.

## Solution Approach

This problem is a variation of **level-order traversal** (BFS) where we alternate the direction of traversal at each level. The key insight is to:
1. Use BFS to traverse level by level
2. Alternate the direction of adding values to each level
3. Use a deque for efficient insertion at both ends

### Key Insights:

1. **Level-by-Level Processing**: Process all nodes at the current level before moving to the next
2. **Direction Alternation**: Toggle between left-to-right and right-to-left at each level
3. **Deque for Efficiency**: Use `deque` to efficiently insert at the beginning when going right-to-left
4. **Standard BFS**: Always add children in the same order (left, then right) to maintain level structure

### Algorithm:

1. **Initialize**: Use a deque for BFS, start with root, set `leftToRight = true`
2. **For each level**:
   - Process all nodes at current level
   - Add values to level vector based on direction
   - Toggle direction for next level
3. **Add children**: Always add left child first, then right child (maintains level order)

## Solution

### **Solution: BFS with Deque and Direction Toggle**

```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def zigzagLevelOrder(self, root):
        rtn = []
        if root is None:
            return rtn

        queue = deque([root])
        leftToRight = True

        while queue:
            size = len(queue)
            level = []

            for i in range(size):
                curr = queue.popleft()

                if leftToRight:
                    level.append(curr.val)
                else:
                    level.insert(0, curr.val)

                if curr.left:
                    queue.append(curr.left)
                if curr.right:
                    queue.append(curr.right)

            rtn.append(level)
            leftToRight = not leftToRight

        return rtn
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Initialize (Lines 4-6)**:
   - Create empty result vector
   - Return empty result if root is null
   - Initialize deque with root node
   - Set `leftToRight = true` for first level

2. **Level Processing (Lines 8-25)**:
   - **For each level**:
     - Get current level size (number of nodes at this level)
     - Create empty level vector
     - **Process each node at current level**:
       - Remove node from front of deque
       - **Add value based on direction**:
         - If `leftToRight`: append to end of level vector
         - If `rightToLeft`: insert at beginning of level vector
       - **Add children**: Always add left child first, then right child to back of deque
     - Add completed level to result
     - **Toggle direction**: `leftToRight = !leftToRight`

3. **Return (Line 26)**: Return the zigzag level order traversal

### **Why This Works:**

- **Deque for BFS**: `deque` allows efficient removal from front and insertion at back
- **Direction Toggle**: Alternates between left-to-right and right-to-left
- **Insertion Strategy**: 
  - Left-to-right: `push_back()` - natural order
  - Right-to-left: `insert(begin())` - reverse order
- **Children Order**: Always add left then right to maintain level structure

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`:**

```
Tree structure:
    3
   / \
  9   20
     /  \
    15   7

Level 0 (leftToRight = true):
  Process: [3]
  Add: level = [3]
  Children: [9, 20]
  Result: [[3]]

Level 1 (leftToRight = false):
  Process: [9, 20]
  Add: level.insert(9) → [9], then level.insert(20) → [20, 9]
  Children: [15, 7]
  Result: [[3], [20, 9]]

Level 2 (leftToRight = true):
  Process: [15, 7]
  Add: level.push_back(15) → [15], then level.push_back(7) → [15, 7]
  Children: []
  Result: [[3], [20, 9], [15, 7]]
```

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of nodes
  - Each node is visited exactly once
  - `insert()` at beginning is O(n) per level, but amortized over all levels is still O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the result and O(w) for the deque where w is maximum width
  - Result stores all n node values
  - Deque stores at most one level of nodes (maximum width)

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 2: Using Index Calculation**

Instead of inserting at the beginning, we can pre-allocate the level vector and calculate the index:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def zigzagLevelOrder(self, root):
        result = []

        if not root:
            return result

        q = deque()
        q.append(root)

        leftToRight = True

        while q:
            size = len(q)
            level = [0] * size

            for i in range(size):
                node = q.popleft()

                index = i if leftToRight else size - 1 - i
                level[index] = node.val

                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)

            result.append(level)
            leftToRight = not leftToRight

        return result
```

**Advantages:**
- More efficient: O(1) index assignment vs O(n) insertion
- Pre-allocated vector avoids reallocation

**Trade-off:**
- Slightly more complex index calculation

## Key Insights

1. **BFS Structure**: Maintains level-by-level traversal
2. **Direction Toggle**: Simple boolean flag to alternate direction
3. **Insertion Strategy**: Choose insertion method based on direction
4. **Children Order**: Always process left then right to maintain level structure

4. **Null Check**: Always check for null root before processing
