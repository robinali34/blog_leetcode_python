# 322. Coin Change

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: coins = [1,3,4], amount = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: 6 = 3 + 3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: The amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 10^4`

## Solution Approach

This is a classic **Dynamic Programming** problem that asks for the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount. Since we can use each coin unlimited times, this is an **unbounded knapsack** problem.

### Key Insights:

1. **Optimal substructure**: The minimum coins for amount `i` can be computed from smaller amounts
2. **Overlapping subproblems**: Same subproblems are solved multiple times
3. **Unbounded knapsack**: Each coin can be used unlimited times
4. **Bottom-up DP**: Build solution from smaller amounts to larger amounts

### Algorithm:

1. **DP array**: `dp[i]` represents minimum coins needed for amount `i`
2. **Base case**: `dp[0] = 0` (0 coins needed for amount 0)
3. **Transition**: For each amount `i`, try each coin and take minimum
4. **Result**: Return `dp[amount]` if it's valid, otherwise `-1`

## Solution

### **Solution: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)**

```python
class Solution:

    def coinChange(self, coins: list[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            for coin in coins:
                if coin <= i:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
        return -1 if dp[amount] > amount else dp[amount]
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Initialize DP array**: `dp[i] = amount + 1` (impossible value for all amounts)
2. **Base case**: `dp[0] = 0` (0 coins needed for amount 0)
3. **Fill DP array**: For each amount `i` from 1 to `amount`:
   - Try each coin `coins[j]`
   - If `coins[j] <= i`, update `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coins[j]] + 1)`
4. **Return result**: If `dp[amount] > amount`, return `-1` (impossible), otherwise return `dp[amount]`

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `coins = [1,3,4], amount = 6`:**

```
Initial: dp = [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

i=1: Try coins [1,3,4]
- coin=1: dp[1] = min(7, dp[0] + 1) = min(7, 1) = 1
- coin=3: 3 > 1, skip
- coin=4: 4 > 1, skip
dp = [0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

i=2: Try coins [1,3,4]
- coin=1: dp[2] = min(7, dp[1] + 1) = min(7, 2) = 2
- coin=3: 3 > 2, skip
- coin=4: 4 > 2, skip
dp = [0, 1, 2, 7, 7, 7, 7]

i=3: Try coins [1,3,4]
- coin=1: dp[3] = min(7, dp[2] + 1) = min(7, 3) = 3
- coin=3: dp[3] = min(3, dp[0] + 1) = min(3, 1) = 1
- coin=4: 4 > 3, skip
dp = [0, 1, 2, 1, 7, 7, 7]

i=4: Try coins [1,3,4]
- coin=1: dp[4] = min(7, dp[3] + 1) = min(7, 2) = 2
- coin=3: dp[4] = min(2, dp[1] + 1) = min(2, 2) = 2
- coin=4: dp[4] = min(2, dp[0] + 1) = min(2, 1) = 1
dp = [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 7, 7]

i=5: Try coins [1,3,4]
- coin=1: dp[5] = min(7, dp[4] + 1) = min(7, 2) = 2
- coin=3: dp[5] = min(2, dp[2] + 1) = min(2, 3) = 2
- coin=4: dp[5] = min(2, dp[1] + 1) = min(2, 2) = 2
dp = [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 7]

i=6: Try coins [1,3,4]
- coin=1: dp[6] = min(7, dp[5] + 1) = min(7, 3) = 3
- coin=3: dp[6] = min(3, dp[3] + 1) = min(3, 2) = 2
- coin=4: dp[6] = min(2, dp[2] + 1) = min(2, 3) = 2
dp = [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]

Result: dp[6] = 2 (coins: 3 + 3)
```

## Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity:** O(amount × coins.length)
- **Outer loop**: O(amount) - iterate through all amounts
- **Inner loop**: O(coins.length) - try each coin for each amount
- **Total**: O(amount × coins.length)

### **Space Complexity:** O(amount)
- **DP array**: O(amount) - stores minimum coins for each amount
- **No additional space**: Only the DP array is used

## Key Points

1. **Dynamic Programming**: Bottom-up approach building from smaller amounts
2. **Unbounded knapsack**: Each coin can be used unlimited times
3. **Optimal substructure**: Solution for amount `i` depends on smaller amounts
4. **Impossible detection**: Use `amount + 1` as impossible value
5. **Efficient**: Single pass through all amounts and coins

## Alternative Approaches

### **Top-Down DP (Memoization)**
```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: list[int], amount: int) -> int:
        memo = [-1] * (amount + 1)
        result = self.dfs(coins, amount, memo)
        return -1 if result == float('inf') else result
    
    def dfs(self, coins: list[int], amount: int, memo: list[int]) -> int:
        if amount == 0:
            return 0
        if amount < 0:
            return float('inf')
        if memo[amount] != -1:
            return memo[amount]
        
        minCoins = float('inf')
        for coin in coins:
            result = self.dfs(coins, amount - coin, memo)
            if result != float('inf'):
                minCoins = min(minCoins, result + 1)
        
        memo[amount] = minCoins
        return minCoins
```
