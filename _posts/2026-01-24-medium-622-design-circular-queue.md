# [Medium] 622. Design Circular Queue

## Problem Statement

Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

Implementation the `MyCircularQueue` class:

- `MyCircularQueue(int k)` Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be `k`.
- `boolean enQueue(int value)` Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return `true` if the operation is successful.
- `boolean deQueue()` Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return `true` if the operation is successful.
- `int Front()` Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.
- `int Rear()` Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.
- `boolean isEmpty()` Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
- `boolean isFull()` Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.

You must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MyCircularQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "Rear", "isFull", "deQueue", "enQueue", "Rear"]
[[3], [1], [2], [3], [4], [], [], [], [4], []]
Output
[null, true, true, true, false, 3, true, true, true, 4]

Explanation
MyCircularQueue myCircularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3);
myCircularQueue.enQueue(1); // return True
myCircularQueue.enQueue(2); // return True
myCircularQueue.enQueue(3); // return True
myCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return False (queue is full)
myCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 3
myCircularQueue.isFull();   // return True
myCircularQueue.deQueue();  // return True
myCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return True
myCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 4
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= k <= 1000`
- `0 <= value <= 1000`
- At most `3000` calls will be made to `enQueue`, `deQueue`, `Front`, `Rear`, `isEmpty`, and `isFull`.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Queue behavior**: What should happen when we try to enqueue into a full queue? (Assumption: Return `false`, don't add the element)

2. **Empty queue operations**: What should `Front()` and `Rear()` return when the queue is empty? (Assumption: Return `-1` as specified in the problem)

3. **Circular property**: When the queue is full and we dequeue, can we immediately enqueue at that position? (Assumption: Yes - that's the circular property, we reuse freed space)

4. **Size tracking**: Should we track the current size separately or calculate it from head/tail pointers? (Assumption: Either approach works, but tracking size separately simplifies implementation)

5. **Thread safety**: Do we need to handle concurrent operations? (Assumption: No - single-threaded operations are sufficient for this problem)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Use a regular array and maintain front and rear pointers. When the array is full, shift all elements to make room, or resize the array. This approach is simple but enqueue/dequeue operations become O(n) due to shifting, which doesn't meet the O(1) requirement. Alternatively, use a linked list, but maintaining the fixed capacity constraint requires tracking size.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use a linked list with a fixed capacity. Maintain head and tail pointers, and track the current size. When enqueuing, add to tail if not full. When dequeuing, remove from head. This achieves O(1) operations but requires dynamic memory allocation for each node. The circular property isn't naturally maintained since we're using a linear linked list structure.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use a fixed-size array with front and rear indices, implementing true circular behavior using modulo arithmetic. Use a sentinel value or a size counter to distinguish between empty and full states (since front == rear can mean either). Enqueue: add at rear, increment rear mod capacity. Dequeue: remove from front, increment front mod capacity. All operations are O(1) with O(k) space. The key insight is using modulo arithmetic to wrap around the array indices, creating a circular buffer without actual circular data structure, and using a size counter or sentinel to handle the empty/full ambiguity.

## Solution Approach

A circular queue is a queue where the last position is connected back to the first position. This allows efficient use of space by reusing freed positions.

### Key Insights:

1. **Circular Array**: Use modulo arithmetic to wrap around when reaching array bounds
2. **Two Approaches**: Array-based (fixed size) or Linked List-based (dynamic nodes)
3. **Tracking State**: Need to track head, tail, and current size/count
4. **Empty vs Full**: Distinguish between empty and full states

## Solution 1: Array-Based Circular Queue

```python
class MyCircularQueue:
MyCircularQueue(k) : q(k), head(0), tail(0), size(0), cap(k) :
def enQueue(self, value):
    if(isFull()) return False
    q[tail] = value
    tail = (tail + 1) % cap
    size += 1
    return True
def deQueue(self):
    if(isEmpty()) return False
    head = (head + 1) % cap
    size -= 1
    return True
def Front(self):
    (-1 if         return isEmpty()  else q[head])
def Rear(self):
    (-1 if         return isEmpty() else q[(tail - 1 + cap) % cap])
def isEmpty(self):
    return size == 0
def isFull(self):
    return size == cap
list[int> q
head, tail, size, cap
/
 Your MyCircularQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
 MyCircularQueue obj = new MyCircularQueue(k)
 bool param_1 = obj.enQueue(value)
 bool param_2 = obj.deQueue()
 param_3 = obj.Front()
 param_4 = obj.Rear()
 bool param_5 = obj.isEmpty()
 bool param_6 = obj.isFull()
/

```

### Algorithm Explanation:

#### **Data Members:**

1. **`q`**: Fixed-size array to store queue elements
2. **`head`**: Index of the front element
3. **`tail`**: Index where next element will be inserted
4. **`size`**: Current number of elements in queue
5. **`cap`**: Maximum capacity of the queue

#### **Key Operations:**

1. **`enQueue(value)`**:
   - Check if queue is full → return `false`
   - Insert value at `tail` position
   - Update tail: `tail = (tail + 1) % cap` (wrap around)
   - Increment size

2. **`deQueue()`**:
   - Check if queue is empty → return `false`
   - Update head: `head = (head + 1) % cap` (wrap around)
   - Decrement size

3. **`Front()`**:
   - Return element at `head` index if not empty

4. **`Rear()`**:
   - Return element at `(tail - 1 + cap) % cap` (previous position, wrapped)

5. **`isEmpty()`**: Check if `size == 0`
6. **`isFull()`**: Check if `size == cap`

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `k = 3`, operations: `enQueue(1)`, `enQueue(2)`, `enQueue(3)`, `enQueue(4)`, `Rear()`, `deQueue()`, `enQueue(4)`, `Rear()`

```
Initial: q = [_, _, _], head = 0, tail = 0, size = 0

enQueue(1): q[0] = 1, tail = 1, size = 1
  q = [1, _, _], head = 0, tail = 1

enQueue(2): q[1] = 2, tail = 2, size = 2
  q = [1, 2, _], head = 0, tail = 2

enQueue(3): q[2] = 3, tail = 0 (wrapped), size = 3
  q = [1, 2, 3], head = 0, tail = 0

enQueue(4): isFull() → false (size == cap)
  Return: false

Rear(): q[(0 - 1 + 3) % 3] = q[2] = 3
  Return: 3

deQueue(): head = (0 + 1) % 3 = 1, size = 2
  q = [_, 2, 3], head = 1, tail = 0

enQueue(4): q[0] = 4, tail = 1, size = 3
  q = [4, 2, 3], head = 1, tail = 1

Rear(): q[(1 - 1 + 3) % 3] = q[0] = 4
  Return: 4 ✓
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for all operations
  - Array access: O(1)
  - Modulo arithmetic: O(1)
  - All operations are constant time

- **Space Complexity:** O(k)
  - Array of size `k`: O(k)
  - Variables: O(1)
  - Overall: O(k)

## Solution 2: Linked List-Based Circular Queue

```python
class MyCircularQueue:
MyCircularQueue(k) : head(None), tail(None), cnt(0), cap(k) :
def enQueue(self, value):
    if(cnt == cap) return False
    Node nextNode = Node(value)
    if cnt == 0:
        head = tail = nextNode
         else :
        tail.next = nextNode
        tail = nextNode
    cnt += 1
    return True
def deQueue(self):
    if(cnt == 0) return False
    Node tmp = head
    head = head.next
    delete tmp
    cnt -= 1
    if(cnt == 0) tail = None
    return True
def Front(self):
    (-1 if         return cnt == 0  else head.val)
def Rear(self):
    (-1 if         return cnt == 0  else tail.val)
def isEmpty(self):
    return cnt == 0
def isFull(self):
    return cnt == cap
struct Node :
val
Node next
Node(v): val(v), next(None):
Node head, tail
cnt, cap
/
 Your MyCircularQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
 MyCircularQueue obj = new MyCircularQueue(k)
 bool param_1 = obj.enQueue(value)
 bool param_2 = obj.deQueue()
 param_3 = obj.Front()
 param_4 = obj.Rear()
 bool param_5 = obj.isEmpty()
 bool param_6 = obj.isFull()
/

```

### Algorithm Explanation:

#### **Node Structure:**

1. **`val`**: Value stored in the node
2. **`next`**: Pointer to next node

#### **Data Members:**

1. **`head`**: Pointer to front node
2. **`tail`**: Pointer to rear node
3. **`cnt`**: Current count of elements
4. **`cap`**: Maximum capacity

#### **Key Operations:**

1. **`enQueue(value)`**:
   - Check if full (`cnt == cap`) → return `false`
   - Create new node with value
   - If empty (`cnt == 0`): set both `head` and `tail` to new node
   - Otherwise: append to `tail->next`, update `tail`
   - Increment `cnt`

2. **`deQueue()`**:
   - Check if empty (`cnt == 0`) → return `false`
   - Save `head`, move `head` to `head->next`
   - Delete old head node
   - Decrement `cnt`
   - If empty after deletion, set `tail = nullptr`

3. **`Front()`**: Return `head->val` if not empty
4. **`Rear()`**: Return `tail->val` if not empty
5. **`isEmpty()`**: Check if `cnt == 0`
6. **`isFull()`**: Check if `cnt == cap`

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `k = 3`, operations: `enQueue(1)`, `enQueue(2)`, `enQueue(3)`, `enQueue(4)`, `Rear()`, `deQueue()`, `enQueue(4)`, `Rear()`

```
Initial: head = nullptr, tail = nullptr, cnt = 0

enQueue(1): Create node(1)
  head → [1] ← tail, cnt = 1

enQueue(2): Create node(2), append
  head → [1] → [2] ← tail, cnt = 2

enQueue(3): Create node(3), append
  head → [1] → [2] → [3] ← tail, cnt = 3

enQueue(4): cnt == cap → false
  Return: false

Rear(): tail->val = 3
  Return: 3

deQueue(): Remove head node
  head → [2] → [3] ← tail, cnt = 2

enQueue(4): Create node(4), append
  head → [2] → [3] → [4] ← tail, cnt = 3

Rear(): tail->val = 4
  Return: 4 ✓
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for all operations
  - Node creation: O(1)
  - Pointer updates: O(1)
  - All operations are constant time

- **Space Complexity:** O(k)
  - Up to `k` nodes: O(k)
  - Variables: O(1)
  - Overall: O(k)

## Key Insights

1. **Circular Array Approach**:
   - Uses modulo arithmetic for wrapping: `(index + 1) % cap`
   - Tracks `size` to distinguish empty vs full
   - More memory efficient (fixed array)

2. **Linked List Approach**:
   - Dynamic node allocation
   - Simpler logic (no modulo needed)
   - Requires memory management (delete nodes)

3. **Empty vs Full Distinction**:
   - Array: Use `size` counter (not just head/tail positions)
   - Linked List: Use `cnt` counter

4. **Rear Element**:
   - Array: `q[(tail - 1 + cap) % cap]` (previous position, wrapped)
   - Linked List: `tail->val` (direct access)

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty queue**: All operations return `-1` or `false` except `isEmpty()` → `true`
2. **Full queue**: `enQueue()` returns `false`
3. **Single element**: After `deQueue()`, queue becomes empty
4. **Capacity 1**: Only one element can be stored
5. **Wrap around**: Array approach wraps `tail` from `cap-1` to `0`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not tracking size**: Using only `head` and `tail` can't distinguish empty from full
2. **Wrong modulo calculation**: `(tail - 1 + cap) % cap` for rear (not `tail - 1`)
3. **Memory leaks**: Not deleting nodes in linked list `deQueue()`
4. **Null pointer**: Not checking `tail == nullptr` after `deQueue()` when empty
5. **Index out of bounds**: Not using modulo for array indices

## Comparison of Approaches

| Aspect | Array-Based | Linked List-Based |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Memory** | Fixed O(k) | Dynamic O(k) |
| **Speed** | Faster (no allocation) | Slower (allocation overhead) |
| **Code Complexity** | Moderate (modulo arithmetic) | Simpler (no modulo) |
| **Memory Management** | None needed | Requires delete |
| **Cache Performance** | Better (contiguous memory) | Worse (scattered nodes) |
| **Best For** | When size is known | When flexibility needed |
