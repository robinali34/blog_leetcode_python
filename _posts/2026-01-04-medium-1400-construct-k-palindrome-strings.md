# 1400. Construct K Palindrome Strings

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return `true` *if you can use all the characters in `s` to construct `k` palindrome strings or `false` otherwise*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "annabelle", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: You can construct two palindromes using all characters in s.
Some possible constructions "anna" + "elble", "anbna" + "elle", etc.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to construct 3 palindromes using all the characters of s.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "true", k = 4
Output: true
Explanation: All the characters in s can be used to construct 4 palindromes: "t", "r", "u", "e".
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Palindrome construction**: What does "construct k palindromes" mean? (Assumption: Split string s into k non-empty palindromic substrings)

2. **Character usage**: Can we use each character only once? (Assumption: Yes - must use all characters from s exactly once)

3. **Palindrome requirement**: What makes a substring a palindrome? (Assumption: Reads same forwards and backwards - symmetric string)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Boolean - true if can construct k palindromes, false otherwise)

5. **K value**: What is the range of k? (Assumption: Per constraints, 1 <= k <= s.length - can have 1 to s.length palindromes)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Try all possible ways to split the string into k palindromic substrings. Use backtracking: try placing a cut at each position, check if the current substring is a palindrome, and recursively try to form k-1 palindromes from the remaining string. This approach has exponential time complexity and is too slow for strings up to 10^5 characters. The challenge is that checking palindromes and exploring all partitions is computationally expensive.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming to check if we can partition the string into k palindromes. Precompute a palindrome table (isPalindrome[i][j]) to check if substring s[i:j] is a palindrome in O(1). Then use DP: dp[i][k] = true if we can partition s[0:i] into k palindromes. However, this still requires exploring many partitions and has O(n² × k) complexity, which may be too slow for large inputs.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use a key mathematical insight: each palindrome can have at most one character with odd frequency (the center). Count how many characters in the string have odd frequency. We need at least that many palindromes (one for each odd-frequency character). The maximum number of palindromes we can create is the string length (one character per palindrome). If k is between the minimum and maximum, it's possible; otherwise, it's not. This reduces the problem to a simple frequency counting problem with O(n) time complexity. The key insight is that we don't need to actually construct the palindromes - we just need to check if it's mathematically possible based on character frequencies.

## Solution Approach

This is a **greedy algorithm** problem with a key mathematical insight about palindromes. The crucial observation is that a palindrome can have **at most one character with odd frequency** (the center character).

### Key Insights:

1. **Palindrome Property**: Each palindrome can have at most 1 character with odd frequency
2. **Minimum Palindromes**: Need at least as many palindromes as characters with odd frequency
3. **Maximum Palindromes**: Can create at most `n` palindromes (one per character)
4. **Feasibility Check**: Can construct `k` palindromes if `min_palindromes <= k <= max_palindromes`

### Algorithm:

1. **Count Frequencies**: Count occurrence of each character in `s`
2. **Count Odd Frequencies**: Count how many characters have odd frequency
3. **Determine Bounds**:
   - **Minimum**: `max(odd_count, 1)` - need at least one palindrome, and at least as many as odd-frequency characters
   - **Maximum**: `n` - can create one palindrome per character
4. **Check Feasibility**: Return `true` if `min <= k <= max`

## Solution

### **Solution: Greedy with Frequency Counting**

```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, s, k):
        right = len(s)

        occ = [0] * 26

        for ch in s:
            occ[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1

        left = 0

        for i in range(26):
            if occ[i] % 2 == 1:
                left += 1

        left = max(left, 1)

        return left <= k and k <= right
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Initialize (Line 4)**:
   - `right`: Maximum number of palindromes = string length `n`
   - Each character can be its own palindrome

2. **Count Character Frequencies (Lines 5-8)**:
   - **Initialize array**: `occ[26]` to count occurrences of each letter
   - **For each character** in `s`:
     - Increment count for that character: `occ[ch - 'a']++`

3. **Count Odd Frequencies (Lines 9-13)**:
   - **Initialize**: `left = 0` (minimum number of palindromes needed)
   - **For each character**:
     - **If frequency is odd**: `occ[i] % 2 == 1`
       - Increment `left` (need at least one palindrome for each odd-frequency character)
   - **Why**: Each palindrome can have at most 1 character with odd frequency (the center)
   - **Minimum**: Need at least `left` palindromes to accommodate all odd-frequency characters

4. **Set Minimum Bound (Line 14)**:
   - `left = max(left, 1)`
   - **Why**: Need at least 1 palindrome (even if all frequencies are even)
   - If all frequencies are even, `left = 0`, but we still need at least 1 palindrome

5. **Check Feasibility (Line 15)**:
   - Return `true` if `left <= k <= right`
   - **Meaning**: Can construct `k` palindromes if `k` is between minimum and maximum

### **Why This Works:**

**Key Insight**: A palindrome can have at most 1 character with odd frequency.

**Strategy**:
1. **Count Odd Frequencies**: Characters with odd frequency need to be centers of palindromes
2. **Minimum Palindromes**: Need at least `max(odd_count, 1)` palindromes
   - At least one for each odd-frequency character
   - At least 1 total (even if all even)
3. **Maximum Palindromes**: Can create at most `n` palindromes (one per character)
4. **Feasibility**: If `k` is between min and max, it's possible

**Example Walkthrough:**

**Example 1: `s = "annabelle"`, `k = 2`**

**Count frequencies:**
```
a: 2 (even)
n: 2 (even)
b: 1 (odd)
e: 2 (even)
l: 2 (even)

Odd frequencies: b (1 character)
```

**Execution:**
```
Step 1: Count frequencies
  occ['a'-'a'] = 2
  occ['n'-'a'] = 2
  occ['b'-'a'] = 1
  occ['e'-'a'] = 2
  occ['l'-'a'] = 2

Step 2: Count odd frequencies
  left = 0
  'a': occ[0] % 2 = 0 (even) → skip
  'b': occ[1] % 2 = 1 (odd) → left++ → left = 1
  'e': occ[4] % 2 = 0 (even) → skip
  'l': occ[11] % 2 = 0 (even) → skip
  'n': occ[13] % 2 = 0 (even) → skip

Step 3: Set bounds
  left = max(1, 1) = 1
  right = 9 (length of "annabelle")

Step 4: Check feasibility
  1 <= 2 <= 9 ✓
  Return: true
```

**Example 2: `s = "leetcode"`, `k = 3`**

**Count frequencies:**
```
l: 1 (odd)
e: 3 (odd)
t: 1 (odd)
c: 1 (odd)
o: 1 (odd)
d: 1 (odd)

Odd frequencies: l, e, t, c, o, d (6 characters)
```

**Execution:**
```
Step 1: Count frequencies
  occ['l'-'a'] = 1
  occ['e'-'a'] = 3
  occ['t'-'a'] = 1
  occ['c'-'a'] = 1
  occ['o'-'a'] = 1
  occ['d'-'a'] = 1

Step 2: Count odd frequencies
  left = 0
  'l': occ[11] % 2 = 1 (odd) → left++ → left = 1
  'e': occ[4] % 2 = 1 (odd) → left++ → left = 2
  't': occ[19] % 2 = 1 (odd) → left++ → left = 3
  'c': occ[2] % 2 = 1 (odd) → left++ → left = 4
  'o': occ[14] % 2 = 1 (odd) → left++ → left = 5
  'd': occ[3] % 2 = 1 (odd) → left++ → left = 6

Step 3: Set bounds
  left = max(6, 1) = 6
  right = 8 (length of "leetcode")

Step 4: Check feasibility
  6 <= 3 <= 8 ✗
  Return: false
```

**Example 3: `s = "true"`, `k = 4`**

**Count frequencies:**
```
t: 1 (odd)
r: 1 (odd)
u: 1 (odd)
e: 1 (odd)

Odd frequencies: t, r, u, e (4 characters)
```

**Execution:**
```
Step 1: Count frequencies
  occ['t'-'a'] = 1
  occ['r'-'a'] = 1
  occ['u'-'a'] = 1
  occ['e'-'a'] = 1

Step 2: Count odd frequencies
  left = 0
  't': occ[19] % 2 = 1 (odd) → left++ → left = 1
  'r': occ[17] % 2 = 1 (odd) → left++ → left = 2
  'u': occ[20] % 2 = 1 (odd) → left++ → left = 3
  'e': occ[4] % 2 = 1 (odd) → left++ → left = 4

Step 3: Set bounds
  left = max(4, 1) = 4
  right = 4 (length of "true")

Step 4: Check feasibility
  4 <= 4 <= 4 ✓
  Return: true
```

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Why Odd Frequencies Matter**

**Palindrome Property**: A palindrome can have at most 1 character with odd frequency (the center).

**Examples**:
- `"aba"`: 'a' appears 2 times (even), 'b' appears 1 time (odd) → valid
- `"abba"`: 'a' appears 2 times (even), 'b' appears 2 times (even) → valid
- `"abcba"`: 'a' appears 2 times (even), 'b' appears 2 times (even), 'c' appears 1 time (odd) → valid
- `"abc"`: 'a', 'b', 'c' each appear 1 time (all odd) → invalid (can't be palindrome)

### **Minimum Number of Palindromes**

**Why `max(odd_count, 1)`?**
- **If `odd_count > 0`**: Need at least `odd_count` palindromes (one center per odd-frequency character)
- **If `odd_count == 0`**: All frequencies are even, but we still need at least 1 palindrome to use all characters

**Example**:
- `s = "aabb"`: All even frequencies → `left = 0`, but `max(0, 1) = 1` (need at least 1 palindrome)
- `s = "aabbc"`: 'c' has odd frequency → `left = 1` (need at least 1 palindrome for 'c')

### **Maximum Number of Palindromes**

**Why `n` (string length)?**
- Each character can be its own palindrome
- Example: `s = "abc"` → can create 3 palindromes: `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`

### **Feasibility Check**

**Why `left <= k <= right`?**
- **If `k < left`**: Not enough palindromes to accommodate all odd-frequency characters → impossible
- **If `k > right`**: More palindromes than characters → impossible
- **If `left <= k <= right`**: Can construct `k` palindromes by:
  - Using `left` palindromes for odd-frequency characters (as centers)
  - Distributing remaining characters among palindromes
  - Creating additional single-character palindromes if needed

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of `s`
  - Count frequencies: O(n) - single pass through string
  - Count odd frequencies: O(26) = O(1) - constant time (26 letters)
  - **Total**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using fixed-size array `occ[26]` (constant space)
  - A few variables (`left`, `right`, `i`)

## Key Points

1. **Palindrome Property**: At most 1 odd-frequency character per palindrome
2. **Minimum Palindromes**: `max(odd_count, 1)` - need at least one for each odd-frequency character
3. **Maximum Palindromes**: `n` - one per character
4. **Feasibility**: Check if `k` is between min and max
5. **Simple Solution**: Just count frequencies and check bounds

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: Frequency Counting (Current Solution)**
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Best for**: Optimal solution, most efficient

### **Approach 2: Hash Map**
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(26) = O(1)
- **Similar**: Use `unordered_map` instead of array (same complexity)

### **Approach 3: Greedy Construction**
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(n)
- **Overkill**: Try to actually construct palindromes (not needed, bounds check is sufficient)

## Edge Cases

1. **All even frequencies**: `s = "aabb"`, `k = 1` → return `true` (left = 1, right = 4)
2. **All odd frequencies**: `s = "abc"`, `k = 3` → return `true` (left = 3, right = 3)
3. **k equals minimum**: `s = "aabbc"`, `k = 1` → return `true` (left = 1, right = 5)
4. **k equals maximum**: `s = "abc"`, `k = 3` → return `true` (left = 3, right = 3)
5. **k less than minimum**: `s = "leetcode"`, `k = 3` → return `false` (left = 6, right = 8)
6. **k greater than maximum**: `s = "abc"`, `k = 4` → return `false` (left = 3, right = 3)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting minimum bound**: Not using `max(left, 1)` when all frequencies are even
2. **Wrong odd count**: Not counting all characters with odd frequency
3. **Wrong bounds**: Confusing minimum and maximum
4. **Off-by-one errors**: Incorrect calculation of bounds
5. **Not understanding palindrome property**: Not realizing each palindrome can have at most 1 odd-frequency character

## Follow-Up: Why Minimum is `max(odd_count, 1)`

**Question**: Why do we need `max(odd_count, 1)` instead of just `odd_count`?

**Answer**:
- **If `odd_count > 0`**: Need at least `odd_count` palindromes (one center per odd-frequency character)
- **If `odd_count == 0`**: All frequencies are even, but we still need at least 1 palindrome to use all characters
- **Example**: `s = "aabb"` (all even) → `odd_count = 0`, but we need at least 1 palindrome to use all 4 characters
- **Therefore**: `left = max(odd_count, 1)` ensures we always have at least 1 palindrome
