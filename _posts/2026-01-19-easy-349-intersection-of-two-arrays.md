# 349. Intersection of Two Arrays

## Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their **intersection**. Each element in the result must be **unique** and you may return the result in **any order**.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The intersection contains only the element 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4] or [4,9]
Explanation: The intersection contains elements 9 and 4. Order does not matter.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Intersection definition**: What exactly is the intersection? (Assumption: Elements that appear in both arrays, each element appears only once in result)

2. **Duplicate handling**: If an element appears multiple times in both arrays, how many times should it appear in result? (Assumption: Only once - intersection contains unique elements)

3. **Order requirement**: Does the order of elements in the result matter? (Assumption: No - order doesn't matter, can return in any order)

4. **Array mutability**: Can we modify the input arrays? (Assumption: No - typically we don't modify input arrays)

5. **Empty arrays**: What if one or both arrays are empty? (Assumption: Return empty array - no intersection)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)**

For each element in the first array, check if it exists in the second array by scanning linearly. Add matching elements to the result, but check for duplicates before adding. This approach has O(n × m) time complexity where n and m are array lengths, which is inefficient. Duplicate checking adds additional overhead.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)**

Sort both arrays, then use two pointers to find common elements. Since arrays are sorted, we can advance pointers based on comparison. This reduces time to O(n log n + m log m) for sorting plus O(n + m) for comparison. However, we still need to handle duplicates in the result, which requires additional checks or a set to track seen elements.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)**

Use a hash set to store elements from the first array. Then iterate through the second array, check if each element exists in the set, and if so, add it to the result and remove it from the set (to avoid duplicates). This achieves O(n + m) average time complexity with O(min(n, m)) space for the hash set. The key insight is using a hash set for O(1) average lookup time and removing elements after adding to the result to ensure uniqueness without additional duplicate checks.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires finding common elements between two arrays, with each element appearing only once in the result. There are several approaches:

1. **Hash Set**: Use set to track elements from first array, then check second array
2. **Sorting + Two Pointers**: Sort both arrays and use two pointers
3. **Boolean Array**: Use fixed-size array if value range is limited
4. **Built-in Set Operations**: Use set intersection operations

### Key Insights:

1. **Uniqueness**: Result must contain unique elements only
2. **Order Independence**: Result can be in any order
3. **Duplicate Handling**: Need to avoid duplicates in result
4. **Efficiency**: Hash set provides O(1) average lookup time

## Solution: Hash Set Approach

```python
class Solution:
def intersection(self, nums1, nums2):
    set[int> seen(nums1.begin(), nums1.end())
    list[int> rtn
    for num in nums2:
        if num in seen:
            rtn.emplace_back(num)
            seen.erase(num)
    return rtn

```

### Algorithm Explanation:

1. **Build Hash Set from First Array**:
   - Create `unordered_set<int> seen` from `nums1`
   - This automatically removes duplicates from `nums1`
   - Provides O(1) average lookup time

2. **Iterate Through Second Array**:
   - For each element `num` in `nums2`:
     - Check if `num` exists in `seen` using `seen.contains(num)`
     - If found:
       - Add `num` to result vector `rtn`
       - **Remove `num` from `seen`** to prevent duplicates in result

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the result vector containing unique intersection elements

### Why Remove from Set?

The key insight is removing elements from `seen` after adding them to the result. This ensures:
- If `nums2` contains duplicates (e.g., `[2,2]`), only the first occurrence is added
- Subsequent occurrences won't match because the element was removed
- Result contains each intersecting element exactly once

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `nums1 = [1,2,2,1]`, `nums2 = [2,2]`

```
Step 1: Build hash set from nums1
  seen = {1, 2}  (duplicates removed)

Step 2: Process nums2
  num = 2:
    seen.contains(2) = true
    rtn.push_back(2) → rtn = [2]
    seen.erase(2) → seen = {1}
  
  num = 2:
    seen.contains(2) = false (was removed)
    Skip

Result: [2] ✓
```

**Input:** `nums1 = [4,9,5]`, `nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]`

```
Step 1: Build hash set from nums1
  seen = {4, 9, 5}

Step 2: Process nums2
  num = 9:
    seen.contains(9) = true
    rtn.push_back(9) → rtn = [9]
    seen.erase(9) → seen = {4, 5}
  
  num = 4:
    seen.contains(4) = true
    rtn.push_back(4) → rtn = [9, 4]
    seen.erase(4) → seen = {5}
  
  num = 9:
    seen.contains(9) = false (was removed)
    Skip
  
  num = 8:
    seen.contains(8) = false
    Skip
  
  num = 4:
    seen.contains(4) = false (was removed)
    Skip

Result: [9, 4] ✓
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m)
  - Building hash set from `nums1`: O(n) where n = `nums1.size()`
  - Iterating through `nums2`: O(m) where m = `nums2.size()`
  - Hash set operations (contains, erase): O(1) average
  - Total: O(n + m)

- **Space Complexity:** O(n + k)
  - Hash set `seen`: O(n) to store unique elements from `nums1`
  - Result vector `rtn`: O(k) where k = number of unique intersection elements
  - Total: O(n + k) = O(n + m) in worst case

## Alternative Approaches

### Solution 2: Sorting + Two Pointers

```python
class Solution:
def intersection(self, nums1, nums2):
    nums1.sort()
    nums2.sort()
    list[int> result
    i = 0, j = 0
    while i < len(nums1)  and  j < len(nums2):
        if nums1[i] < nums2[j]:
            i += 1
             else if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) :
            j += 1
             else :
            # Found intersection
            if not result  or  result[-1] != nums1[i]:
                result.append(nums1[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
    return result

```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n log n + m log m) for sorting + O(n + m) for two pointers = O(n log n + m log m)
- Space: O(1) extra space (excluding output)

**Pros:** No extra space for hash set  
**Cons:** Modifies input arrays, slower for small arrays

### Solution 3: Boolean Array (Fixed Range)

```python
class Solution:
def intersection(self, nums1, nums2):
    bool present[1001] = :False
for num in nums1:
    present[num] = True
list[int> result
for num in nums2:
    if present[num]:
        result.append(num)
        present[num] = False # Mark as added
return result

```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n + m)
- Space: O(1001) = O(1) fixed space

**Pros:** Very fast, constant space  
**Cons:** Only works when value range is limited (0-1000)

### Solution 4: Using Set Operations

```python
class Solution:
def intersection(self, nums1, nums2):
    set[int> set1(nums1.begin(), nums1.end())
    set[int> set2(nums2.begin(), nums2.end())
    list[int> result
    for num in set1:
        if set2.count(num):
            result.append(num)
    return result

```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n + m)
- Space: O(n + m)

**Pros:** Clean and readable  
**Cons:** Uses more space (two sets)

## Key Insights

1. **Hash Set for Uniqueness**: Automatically handles duplicates
2. **Erase After Add**: Prevents duplicate results efficiently
3. **Order Independence**: Can return result in any order
4. **Space-Time Trade-off**: Hash set uses more space but provides O(1) lookup

## Edge Cases

1. **No intersection**: `nums1 = [1,2,3]`, `nums2 = [4,5,6]` → `[]`
2. **Complete overlap**: `nums1 = [1,2,3]`, `nums2 = [1,2,3]` → `[1,2,3]`
3. **One array empty**: `nums1 = []`, `nums2 = [1,2]` → `[]`
4. **Duplicates in both**: `nums1 = [1,1,2,2]`, `nums2 = [2,2]` → `[2]`
5. **Single element**: `nums1 = [1]`, `nums2 = [1]` → `[1]`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not removing from set**: Results in duplicate elements in output
2. **Using vector instead of set**: Doesn't handle duplicates in `nums1`
3. **Wrong comparison**: Comparing entire arrays instead of elements
4. **Forgetting empty check**: Not handling empty arrays
5. **Order dependency**: Trying to maintain order when not needed

## Comparison of Approaches

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Hash Set** | O(n + m) | O(n + k) | Fast, simple, handles duplicates | Extra space |
| **Sorting + Two Pointers** | O(n log n + m log m) | O(1) | No extra space | Modifies input, slower |
| **Boolean Array** | O(n + m) | O(1) | Very fast, constant space | Limited value range |
| **Set Operations** | O(n + m) | O(n + m) | Clean code | More space |

## When to Use Each Approach

- **Hash Set**: General purpose, most common solution
- **Sorting + Two Pointers**: When space is critical, input can be modified
- **Boolean Array**: When value range is small and known (0-1000)
- **Set Operations**: When code clarity is priority
