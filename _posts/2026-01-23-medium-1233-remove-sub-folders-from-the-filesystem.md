# 1233. Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem

## Problem Statement

Given a list of folders `folder`, return *the folders after removing all **sub-folders** in those folders*. You may return the answer in **any order**.

If a `folder[i]` is located within another `folder[j]`, it is called a **sub-folder** of it.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: `'/'` followed by one or more lowercase English letters.

For example, `"/leetcode"` and `"/leetcode/problems"` are valid paths while an empty string and `"/"` are not.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Explanation: None of the folders are subfolders of another folder.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 10^4`
- `2 <= folder[i].length <= 100`
- `folder[i]` contains only lowercase letters and `'/'`
- `folder[i]` always starts with `'/'`
- Each folder name is **unique**

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Subfolder definition**: What exactly defines a subfolder? (Assumption: Folder A is a subfolder of folder B if A's path starts with B's path followed by '/', e.g., "/a/b" is subfolder of "/a")

2. **Path format**: Are all paths absolute (starting with '/')? (Assumption: Yes - all paths start with '/' and don't have trailing '/')

3. **Case sensitivity**: Are folder names case-sensitive? (Assumption: Yes - only lowercase letters are allowed per constraints)

4. **Empty folders**: Can there be empty folder paths? (Assumption: No - minimum length is 2, so at least "/a" format)

5. **Duplicate folders**: Can the same folder path appear multiple times? (Assumption: Based on constraints, folder names are unique, so no duplicates)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

For each folder path, check if it's a subfolder of any other folder by checking if any other path is a prefix of it. Remove all folders that are subfolders of others. This requires comparing each folder with every other folder, giving O(n² × m) complexity where n is the number of folders and m is the average path length. This is too slow for large inputs.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Sort the folder paths lexicographically. After sorting, if a folder is a subfolder of another, its parent must appear before it in the sorted order. Iterate through sorted paths, and for each path, check if it starts with the previous path followed by '/'. If yes, it's a subfolder and should be removed. This reduces complexity to O(n log n + n × m) for sorting and checking, which is better but can be optimized further.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use a Trie data structure to efficiently check prefix relationships. Insert all folder paths into a trie, marking nodes that represent complete folder paths. When inserting, if we encounter a node already marked as a complete path, the current path is a subfolder and should be skipped. Alternatively, after building the trie, traverse it and collect only paths that are not subfolders. This achieves O(n × m) time complexity where m is the average path length, as we process each character once. The trie naturally handles prefix checking efficiently, making it the optimal approach for this problem.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires identifying and removing folder paths that are subfolders of other folders. A folder is a subfolder if its path is a prefix of another folder's path.

### Key Insights:

1. **Prefix Matching**: A folder is a subfolder if its path is a prefix of another folder
2. **Trie Approach**: Build a trie of all folders, then check if any prefix is marked as end
3. **Sorting Approach**: Sort folders lexicographically, then check if current folder is a prefix of previous
4. **Path Parsing**: Split paths by `'/'` to process folder names individually

## Solution 1: Trie-Based Approach

```python
struct TrieNode:
bool isEnd
dict[str, TrieNode> children
TrieNode(): isEnd(False):
class Solution:
Solution(): root(new TrieNode()) :
~Solution() :deleteTrie(root)
def removeSubfolders(self, folder):
    for path in folder:
        TrieNode curr = root
        istringstream iss(path)
        str folderName
        while getline(iss, folderName, '/'):
            if(not folderName) continue
            if not curr.folderName in children:
                curr.children[folderName] = new TrieNode()
            curr = curr.children[folderName]
        curr.isEnd = True
    list[str> rtn
    for path in folder:
        TrieNode curr = root
        istringstream iss(path)
        str folderName
        bool isSubFolder = False
        while getline(iss, folderName, '/'):
            if(not folderName) continue
            it = curr.children.find(folderName)
            if(it == curr.children.end()) break
            TrieNode nextNode = it.second
            if nextNode.isEnd  and  iss.rdbuf().in_avail() != 0:
                isSubFolder = True
                break
            curr = nextNode
        if not isSubFolder) rtn.append(path:
    return rtn
TrieNode root
def deleteTrie(self, node):
    if(not node) return
    for([_, child]: node.children) :
    deleteTrie(child)
delete node

```

### Algorithm Explanation:

#### **TrieNode Structure:**

1. **`isEnd`**: Marks if this node represents the end of a folder path
2. **`children`**: Map from folder name to child TrieNode

#### **Build Trie (First Pass):**

1. **Parse Each Path**: Split path by `'/'` using `istringstream` and `getline`
2. **Skip Empty**: Ignore empty strings (from leading `/`)
3. **Create Nodes**: For each folder name, create node if missing
4. **Mark End**: Mark final node as `isEnd = true`

#### **Check Subfolders (Second Pass):**

1. **Traverse Path**: For each folder path, traverse trie following folder names
2. **Check Prefix**: If we encounter a node with `isEnd = true` and there are more folders remaining (`iss.rdbuf()->in_avail() != 0`), it's a subfolder
3. **Add to Result**: Only add folders that are not subfolders

#### **Memory Management:**

- **Destructor**: Recursively deletes all nodes to prevent memory leaks
- **`deleteTrie`**: Helper function for recursive deletion

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]`

```
Step 1: Build Trie
  "/a": root -> "a" (isEnd=true)
  "/a/b": root -> "a" -> "b" (isEnd=true)
  "/c/d": root -> "c" -> "d" (isEnd=true)
  "/c/d/e": root -> "c" -> "d" -> "e" (isEnd=true)
  "/c/f": root -> "c" -> "f" (isEnd=true)

Step 2: Check Each Path
  "/a": Traverse "a", isEnd=true, no more folders → NOT subfolder ✓
  "/a/b": Traverse "a", isEnd=true, more folders exist → IS subfolder ✗
  "/c/d": Traverse "c" -> "d", isEnd=true, no more → NOT subfolder ✓
  "/c/d/e": Traverse "c" -> "d", isEnd=true, more exist → IS subfolder ✗
  "/c/f": Traverse "c" -> "f", isEnd=true, no more → NOT subfolder ✓

Result: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"] ✓
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n × m)
  - Building trie: O(n × m) where n = number of folders, m = average path length
  - Checking subfolders: O(n × m)
  - Overall: O(n × m)

- **Space Complexity:** O(n × m)
  - Trie structure: O(n × m) in worst case
  - Result array: O(n)
  - Overall: O(n × m)

## Solution 2: Sorting-Based Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def removeSubfolders(self, folder):
        folder.sort()
        rtn = []
        
        for f in folder:
            if (not rtn or
                not (f.startswith(rtn[-1] + "/"))):
                rtn.append(f)
        
        return rtn
```

### Algorithm Explanation:

1. **Sort Folders**: Sort all folders lexicographically
   - After sorting, parent folders come before their subfolders
   - Example: `["/a", "/a/b", "/c/d"]` stays in order

2. **Check Prefix**: For each folder:
   - If result is empty, add it
   - Otherwise, check if current folder is a prefix of the last added folder
   - **Key Check**: `f.compare(0, rtn.back().size(), rtn.back()) != 0`
     - Compares first `rtn.back().size()` characters of `f` with `rtn.back()`
     - Returns non-zero if they differ
   - **Additional Check**: `f[rtn.back().size()] != '/'`
     - Ensures the next character after prefix is `/` (not just a prefix match)
     - Prevents false positives like `/a/bc` matching `/a/b`

3. **Add to Result**: Only add if not a subfolder

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]`

```
Step 1: Sort
  ["/a", "/a/b", "/c/d", "/c/d/e", "/c/f"]

Step 2: Process
  "/a": rtn empty → add → rtn = ["/a"]
  "/a/b": compare("/a/b", 0, 2, "/a") = 0 (matches)
          "/a/b"[2] = '/' → IS subfolder ✗
  "/c/d": compare("/c/d", 0, 2, "/a") != 0 → NOT subfolder ✓
          rtn = ["/a", "/c/d"]
  "/c/d/e": compare("/c/d/e", 0, 4, "/c/d") = 0 (matches)
            "/c/d/e"[4] = '/' → IS subfolder ✗
  "/c/f": compare("/c/f", 0, 4, "/c/d") != 0 → NOT subfolder ✓
          rtn = ["/a", "/c/d", "/c/f"]

Result: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"] ✓
```

### Why the Additional Check is Needed:

Consider: `folder = ["/a/b", "/a/bc"]`

- Without `f[rtn.back().size()] != '/'` check:
  - `/a/bc` would be incorrectly identified as subfolder of `/a/b`
- With the check:
  - `"/a/bc"[4] = 'c'` (not `/`) → NOT subfolder ✓

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n + n × m)
  - Sorting: O(n log n)
  - Processing: O(n × m) where m = average path length
  - Overall: O(n log n + n × m)

- **Space Complexity:** O(1) excluding output
  - Sorting: O(1) if in-place
  - Result array: O(n)
  - Overall: O(n) for output

## Key Insights

1. **Prefix Matching**: A folder is a subfolder if its path is a prefix of another folder
2. **Trie Approach**: 
   - Efficient for checking if any prefix exists
   - More memory intensive but clearer logic
3. **Sorting Approach**: 
   - Simpler code, more efficient
   - Leverages lexicographic ordering property
4. **Path Parsing**: Use `istringstream` and `getline` to split by `/`
5. **Edge Case**: Check that prefix match is followed by `/` to avoid false positives

## Edge Cases

1. **Single folder**: `["/a"]` → `["/a"]`
2. **No subfolders**: `["/a/b", "/c/d"]` → `["/a/b", "/c/d"]`
3. **All subfolders**: `["/a", "/a/b", "/a/b/c"]` → `["/a"]`
4. **Similar prefixes**: `["/a/b", "/a/bc"]` → Both kept (not subfolders)
5. **Deep nesting**: `["/a", "/a/b", "/a/b/c", "/a/b/c/d"]` → `["/a"]`

## Common Mistakes

1. **False prefix match**: `/a/bc` matching `/a/b` without checking next character
2. **Wrong comparison**: Using `startsWith` without verifying `/` boundary
3. **Memory leaks**: Not deleting trie nodes in C++
4. **Empty string handling**: Not skipping empty strings from leading `/`
5. **Sorting order**: Not understanding lexicographic ordering

## Comparison of Approaches

| Aspect | Trie Approach | Sorting Approach |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Time** | O(n × m) | O(n log n + n × m) |
| **Space** | O(n × m) | O(n) |
| **Code Complexity** | More verbose | Simpler |
| **Memory Management** | Requires cleanup | No cleanup needed |
| **Clarity** | More explicit | More concise |
| **Best For** | When paths are long | When simplicity preferred |
