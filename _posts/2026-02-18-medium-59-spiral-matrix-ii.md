# 59. Spiral Matrix II

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, generate an `n × n` matrix filled with elements from `1` to `n²` in spiral order (clockwise).

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output:
1  2  3
8  9  4
7  6  5
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: [[1]]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 20`

## Clarification Questions

1. **Direction**: Clockwise from top-left? (Assumption: Yes — right, down, left, up.)
2. **Starting value**: Fill from 1 to n²? (Assumption: Yes.)
3. **n = 1**: Return [[1]]? (Assumption: Yes.)
4. **Matrix type**: 2D list of integers? (Assumption: Yes.)
5. **In-place**: Generate into new matrix? (Assumption: Yes, return new matrix.)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Simulation (5 min)** — Maintain boundaries (top, bottom, left, right). Fill top row left→right, right col top→bottom, bottom row right→left (if different from top), left col bottom→top (if different from right). Shrink boundaries. Repeat.

**Step 2: Layer-by-layer (7 min)** — Same idea; for each layer fill four sides in order. Handle n odd (center cell) and n even (no center). O(n²) time and space.

**Step 3: Optimized (8 min)** — Single loop with direction vector; change direction when hitting boundary or already-filled cell. Alternatively keep boundary variables; both are O(n²).

## Solution Approach

### Core Observations

- The matrix is square
- We fill numbers `1 → n²` in a clockwise spiral
- This is a **simulation** problem -- no DP or graph tricks, just precise boundary control

### Layer-by-Layer (Boundary Shrinking)

Think of the matrix as concentric layers (rings). There are `⌈n/2⌉` layers. For each layer, fill four sides in order:

1. **Left → Right** (top row of this layer)
2. **Top → Bottom** (right column)
3. **Right → Left** (bottom row)
4. **Bottom → Top** (left column)

After each complete ring, shrink inward to the next layer.

### Walk-Through (n = 4)

```
Layer 0:  1  2  3  4    Layer 1:  .  .  .  .
         12  .  .  5              .  6  7  .
         11  .  .  6              . 10  .  .
         10  9  8  7              .  9  .  .

Layer 0 fills the outer ring (1–12)
Layer 1 fills the inner ring (13–16)
```

### Why Layer Index Works

For layer `k`:
- Top-left corner is at `(k, k)`
- Bottom-right corner is at `(n-k-1, n-k-1)`
- Each of the four sides has carefully adjusted start/end to avoid double-counting corners

## Approach: Layer-by-Layer -- $O(n^2)$

Iterate over layers from `0` to `(n+1)/2 - 1`. For each layer, fill the four sides with incrementing counter.

{% raw %}
```python
class Solution:
    def generateMatrix(self, n):
        rtn = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        cnt = 1
        
        for layer in range((n + 1) // 2):
            # top row (left → right)
            for ptr in range(layer, n - layer):
                rtn[layer][ptr] = cnt
                cnt += 1
            
            # right column (top → bottom)
            for ptr in range(layer + 1, n - layer):
                rtn[ptr][n - layer - 1] = cnt
                cnt += 1
            
            # bottom row (right → left)
            for ptr in range(n - layer - 2, layer - 1, -1):
                rtn[n - layer - 1][ptr] = cnt
                cnt += 1
            
            # left column (bottom → top)
            for ptr in range(n - layer - 2, layer, -1):
                rtn[ptr][layer] = cnt
                cnt += 1
        
        return rtn
```
{% endraw %}

**Time**: $O(n^2)$ -- each cell filled exactly once
**Space**: $O(n^2)$ for the output matrix (no extra space)

## Alternative: Direction Array Simulation

Instead of explicit layer logic, use direction vectors and rotate when hitting a boundary or an already-filled cell. Often shorter code.

{% raw %}
```python
class Solution:
    def generateMatrix(self, n):
        mat = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        # right, down, left, up
        dirs = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        
        d = 0  # direction index
        r, c = 0, 0
        
        for num in range(1, n * n + 1):
            mat[r][c] = num
            
            nr = r + dirs[d][0]
            nc = c + dirs[d][1]
            
            # change direction if out of bounds or already filled
            if nr < 0 or nr >= n or nc < 0 or nc >= n or mat[nr][nc] != 0:
                d = (d + 1) % 4
                nr = r + dirs[d][0]
                nc = c + dirs[d][1]
            
            r, c = nr, nc
        
        return mat
```
{% endraw %}

**Time**: $O(n^2)$
**Space**: $O(n^2)$

## Common Mistakes

- **Double-filling the center**: when `n` is odd, the center cell belongs to only one side
- **Off-by-one on boundaries**: each side must carefully exclude the corners already filled by the previous side
- **Wrong loop bounds on the return sides**: the "right → left" and "bottom → top" loops start at `n - layer - 2`, not `n - layer - 1`

## Key Takeaways

- This is a pure **implementation accuracy** problem -- recognize it as spiral simulation immediately
- **Layer-by-layer** is safer and more explicit about boundaries
- **Direction array** is shorter but requires checking "already filled" cells
- Both approaches are $O(n^2)$ and optimal since every cell must be visited
