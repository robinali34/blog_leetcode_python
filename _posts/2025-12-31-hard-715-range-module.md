# [Hard] 715. Range Module

## Problem Statement

A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Design a data structure to track the ranges represented as **half-open intervals** `[left, right)`.

Implement the `RangeModule` class:

- `RangeModule()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
- `void addRange(int left, int right)` Adds the **half-open interval** `[left, right)`, tracking every real number in that interval. Adding an interval that partially overlaps with currently tracked numbers should add any numbers in the interval `[left, right)` that are not already tracked.
- `bool queryRange(int left, int right)` Returns `true` if every real number in the interval `[left, right)` is currently being tracked, and `false` otherwise.
- `void removeRange(int left, int right)` Stops tracking every real number currently being tracked in the **half-open interval** `[left, right)`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input
["RangeModule", "addRange", "removeRange", "queryRange", "queryRange", "queryRange"]
[[], [10, 20], [14, 16], [10, 14], [13, 15], [16, 17]]
Output
[null, null, null, true, false, true]

Explanation
RangeModule rangeModule = new RangeModule();
rangeModule.addRange(10, 20);  // Track [10, 20)
rangeModule.removeRange(14, 16); // Stop tracking [14, 16)
rangeModule.queryRange(10, 14); // Returns true (every number in [10, 14) is being tracked)
rangeModule.queryRange(13, 15); // Returns false (numbers like 13.5, 14, 14.5, 15 in [13, 15) are not being tracked)
rangeModule.queryRange(16, 17); // Returns true (the number 16 in [16, 17) is still being tracked, despite the removeRange operation)
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= left < right <= 10^9`
- At most `10^4` calls will be made to `addRange`, `queryRange`, and `removeRange`.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Range format**: Are ranges inclusive or exclusive? (Assumption: Half-open interval [left, right) - left is inclusive, right is exclusive)

2. **Overlapping ranges**: How should we handle overlapping ranges when adding? (Assumption: Merge overlapping ranges - union of all tracked ranges)

3. **Partial removal**: What happens when removing a range that partially overlaps tracked ranges? (Assumption: Remove only the overlapping portion - split ranges if needed)

4. **Query definition**: What does queryRange check? (Assumption: Returns true if every number in [left, right) is being tracked)

5. **Range boundaries**: What's the valid range for left and right? (Assumption: 1 <= left < right <= 10^9 per constraints)

## Interview Deduction Process (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (8 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to track ranges. Let me use a simple list and check/merge manually."

**Naive Solution**: Store all intervals in an unsorted list. For each operation, linearly scan through all intervals to find overlaps, then manually merge or split.

**Complexity**: O(n) per operation, O(n^2) worst case for merging

**Issues**:
- O(n) per operation - linear scan through all intervals
- O(n^2) worst case when merging requires checking all pairs
- No efficient way to find overlapping intervals
- Complex merge/split logic with many edge cases
- Doesn't scale well for many operations

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (10 minutes)
**Insight**: "I need sorted intervals for efficient operations. A sorted vector with binary search can help find positions quickly."

**Improved Solution**: Maintain intervals in a sorted vector. Use binary search to find insertion points, but still need O(n) for vector insertions/deletions.

**Complexity**: O(log n) search + O(n) insertion/deletion per operation

**Improvements**:
- Binary search reduces search time to O(log n)
- Still O(n) for insertions/deletions due to vector shifting
- Better than brute-force but not optimal
- Query becomes O(log n) which is good

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (12 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "A sorted map (TreeMap) provides O(log n) operations and efficient merging. It handles insertions/deletions efficiently."

**Best Solution**: Use `std::map` to store intervals sorted by start point. Use `upper_bound()` to find insertion points, then merge or split intervals as needed.

**Complexity**: O(k log n) per operation where k = number of intervals affected

**Key Realizations**:
1. `std::map` provides O(log n) operations and automatic sorting
2. `upper_bound()` efficiently finds insertion points in O(log n)
3. Merge logic handles overlapping intervals elegantly by extending boundaries
4. Split logic handles partial overlaps correctly by truncating/creating intervals
5. O(k log n) complexity where k is number of intervals affected (typically small)
6. Much more efficient than linear approaches for many operations

## Solution Structure Breakdown

### Evolution from Naive to Optimized

**Naive Approach** (List-based):
- **Structure**: Store intervals in unsorted list, linear scan
- **Complexity**: O(n) per operation, O(n^2) worst case
- **Limitation**: No efficient way to find/merge intervals

**Semi-Optimized Approach** (Sorted Vector):
- **Structure**: Maintain sorted vector, binary search for position
- **Complexity**: O(log n) search + O(n) insertion/deletion
- **Improvement**: Faster search, but still O(n) for modifications

**Optimized Approach** (Sorted Map):
- **Structure**: `std::map` for automatic sorting and O(log n) operations
- **Complexity**: O(k log n) where k = intervals affected
- **Enhancement**: Efficient merge/split operations

### Code Structure Comparison

| Approach | Data Structure | Search | Insert/Delete | Merge Logic |
|----------|---------------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Naive** | Unsorted list | O(n) | O(1) | O(n^2) |
| **Semi-Opt** | Sorted vector | O(log n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Optimized** | Sorted map | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(k log n) |

## Solution Approach

This problem requires efficiently managing intervals (ranges) with support for adding, querying, and removing. We can use a **sorted map** (like `std::map` in C++) to store non-overlapping intervals, where keys are start points and values are end points.

### Key Insights:

1. **Sorted Map**: Use `map<int, int>` to store intervals in sorted order by start point
2. **Merge Intervals**: When adding, merge overlapping or adjacent intervals
3. **Split Intervals**: When removing, split intervals that partially overlap
4. **Query Check**: Check if query range is completely contained in an existing interval

### Algorithm:

1. **addRange**: Find overlapping intervals, merge them, remove subsumed intervals
2. **queryRange**: Check if query range is completely within a single interval
3. **removeRange**: Split intervals that overlap with removal range

## Solution

### **Solution 1: Brute-Force List-Based Approach**

**Time Complexity:** O(n) per operation, O(n^2) worst case for merging  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Store all intervals in an unsorted list and linearly scan for operations.

```python
class RangeModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.intervals = []

    def mergeIntervals(self):
        if not self.intervals:
            return

        self.intervals.sort()
        merged = [self.intervals[0]]

        for i in range(1, len(self.intervals)):
            l, r = self.intervals[i]
            last_l, last_r = merged[-1]

            if merged[-1][1] >= l:
                merged[-1] = (last_l, max(last_r, r))
            else:
                merged.append((l, r))

        self.intervals = merged

    def addRange(self, left, right):
        self.intervals.append((left, right))
        self.mergeIntervals()

    def queryRange(self, left, right):
        for l, r in self.intervals:
            if l <= left and right <= r:
                return True
        return False

    def removeRange(self, left, right):
        newIntervals = []

        for l, r in self.intervals:
            if r <= left or l >= right:
                newIntervals.append((l, r))
            else:
                if l < left:
                    newIntervals.append((l, left))
                if r > right:
                    newIntervals.append((right, r))

        self.intervals = newIntervals
```

**Note**: This approach is inefficient due to O(n) operations and O(n^2) worst case merging.

### **Solution 2: Sorted Vector with Binary Search**

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) search + O(n) insertion/deletion per operation  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Maintain sorted intervals using a vector with binary search for finding positions.

```python
class RangeModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.intervals = []

    def findInsertPos(self, left):
        low, high = 0, len(self.intervals)

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2

            if self.intervals[mid][0] <= left:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid

        return low

    def addRange(self, left, right):
        pos = self.findInsertPos(left)
        self.intervals.insert(pos, (left, right))
        self.mergeIntervals()

    def queryRange(self, left, right):
        pos = self.findInsertPos(left)

        if pos > 0:
            l, r = self.intervals[pos - 1]
            if l <= left and right <= r:
                return True

        return False

    def removeRange(self, left, right):
        newIntervals = []

        for l, r in self.intervals:
            if r <= left or l >= right:
                newIntervals.append((l, r))
            else:
                if l < left:
                    newIntervals.append((l, left))
                if r > right:
                    newIntervals.append((right, r))

        self.intervals = newIntervals

    def mergeIntervals(self):
        if not self.intervals:
            return

        self.intervals.sort()
        merged = [self.intervals[0]]

        for i in range(1, len(self.intervals)):
            l, r = self.intervals[i]
            last_l, last_r = merged[-1]

            if last_r >= l:
                merged[-1] = (last_l, max(last_r, r))
            else:
                merged.append((l, r))

        self.intervals = merged
```

**Note**: Better than brute-force with O(log n) search, but still O(n) for insertions/deletions.

### **Solution 3: Map-Based Interval Management (Recommended)**

```python
import bisect

class RangeModule:
    def __init__(self):
        # store disjoint intervals [l, r)
        self.intervals = []

    def _find_left(self, x):
        # first interval with start > x
        return bisect.bisect_left(self.intervals, (x,))

    def addRange(self, left, right):
        i = bisect.bisect_left(self.intervals, (left, 0))
        new_left, new_right = left, right

        # merge overlapping on the left side
        if i > 0 and self.intervals[i - 1][1] >= left:
            i -= 1
            new_left = min(new_left, self.intervals[i][0])
            new_right = max(new_right, self.intervals[i][1])
            self.intervals.pop(i)

        # merge overlapping intervals to the right
        while i < len(self.intervals) and self.intervals[i][0] <= right:
            new_right = max(new_right, self.intervals[i][1])
            self.intervals.pop(i)

        self.intervals.insert(i, (new_left, new_right))

    def queryRange(self, left, right):
        i = bisect.bisect_right(self.intervals, (left, float('inf')))

        if i == 0:
            return False

        l, r = self.intervals[i - 1]
        return l <= left and right <= r

    def removeRange(self, left, right):
        res = []
        for l, r in self.intervals:
            # no overlap
            if r <= left or l >= right:
                res.append((l, r))
            else:
                # left split
                if l < left:
                    res.append((l, left))
                # right split
                if r > right:
                    res.append((right, r))

        self.intervals = res
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

#### **1. addRange (Lines 10-24)**

**Purpose**: Add interval `[left, right)`, merging with overlapping intervals.

**Steps**:
1. **Find insertion point** (Line 11): `upper_bound(left)` finds first interval starting after `left`
2. **Check previous interval** (Lines 12-19):
   - If previous interval ends at or after `right`: already covered, return
   - If previous interval ends at or after `left`: merge by extending `left` to previous start
3. **Merge overlapping intervals** (Lines 20-23):
   - While current interval starts before or at `right`: merge by extending `right`
   - Remove merged intervals
4. **Insert merged interval** (Line 24): Add final merged interval

**Example**:
```
Initial: intervals = {[10, 20]}
addRange(15, 25):
  it = upper_bound(15) → points to [10, 20]
  prev(it) = [10, 20]
  start->second (20) >= left (15) → merge
  left = 10
  it->first (10) <= right (25) → merge
  right = max(25, 20) = 25
  Result: {[10, 25]}
```

#### **2. queryRange (Lines 26-31)**

**Purpose**: Check if entire range `[left, right)` is tracked.

**Steps**:
1. **Find candidate interval** (Line 27): `upper_bound(left)` finds first interval after `left`
2. **Check previous interval** (Line 28): Move to previous interval (might contain `left`)
3. **Verify coverage** (Line 30): Check if previous interval completely covers `[left, right)`

**Example**:
```
intervals = {[10, 20]}
queryRange(12, 18):
  it = upper_bound(12) → points to [10, 20]
  prev(it) = [10, 20]
  Check: right (18) <= it->second (20) → true
```

#### **3. removeRange (Lines 33-56)**

**Purpose**: Remove interval `[left, right)` from tracked ranges.

**Steps**:
1. **Find starting point** (Line 34): `upper_bound(left)` finds first interval after `left`
2. **Handle previous interval** (Lines 35-50):
   - If previous interval completely contains `[left, right)`:
     - Split into `[start, left)` and `[right, end)` if needed
   - If previous interval partially overlaps:
     - Truncate to `[start, left)`
3. **Remove/truncate following intervals** (Lines 51-56):
   - Remove intervals completely within `[left, right)`
   - Truncate interval that extends beyond `right`

**Example**:
```
intervals = {[10, 20]}
removeRange(14, 16):
  it = upper_bound(14) → points to [10, 20]
  prev(it) = [10, 20]
  start->second (20) >= right (16) → split needed
  start->first (10) != left (14) → truncate to [10, 14)
  right (16) != ri (20) → add [16, 20)
  Result: {[10, 14), [16, 20)}
```

### **Detailed Example Walkthrough:**

**Operations:**
```
1. addRange(10, 20)
   intervals = {[10, 20)}

2. addRange(15, 25)
   - Check [10, 20): overlaps, merge
   intervals = {[10, 25)}

3. removeRange(14, 16)
   - [10, 25) overlaps with [14, 16)
   - Split: [10, 14) and [16, 25)
   intervals = {[10, 14), [16, 25)}

4. queryRange(10, 14)
   - Find interval containing 10: [10, 14)
   - Check: 14 <= 14? Yes → true

5. queryRange(13, 15)
   - Find interval containing 13: [10, 14)
   - Check: 15 <= 14? No → false

6. queryRange(16, 17)
   - Find interval containing 16: [16, 25)
   - Check: 17 <= 25? Yes → true
```

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Key Insight: Sorted Map for Intervals**

Using `map<int, int>` provides:
- **Sorted keys**: Intervals stored by start point
- **O(log n) operations**: Insert, delete, search
- **Efficient merging**: Easy to find overlapping intervals

### **Interval Merging Logic**

**addRange** merges intervals by:
1. Finding intervals that overlap or are adjacent
2. Extending `left` to earliest start
3. Extending `right` to latest end
4. Removing all subsumed intervals

### **Interval Splitting Logic**

**removeRange** splits intervals by:
1. Truncating intervals that start before `left`
2. Removing intervals completely within `[left, right)`
3. Creating new interval for part extending beyond `right`

## Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity:**
- **addRange**: O(k log n) where k = number of intervals to merge
- **queryRange**: O(log n) - binary search in map
- **removeRange**: O(k log n) where k = number of intervals to remove/split
- **n** = number of intervals stored

### **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Map storage**: O(n) intervals stored
- **Each operation**: O(1) extra space

## Key Points

1. **Half-Open Intervals**: `[left, right)` means left included, right excluded
2. **Sorted Map**: Maintains intervals in sorted order for efficient operations
3. **Merging**: Automatically merges overlapping/adjacent intervals
4. **Splitting**: Handles partial overlaps by splitting intervals
5. **Efficient Queries**: O(log n) lookup using binary search

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty intervals**: `left >= right` should be handled (though constraints say `left < right`)
2. **No overlapping**: Adding non-overlapping interval creates new entry
3. **Complete overlap**: Adding interval already covered does nothing
4. **Remove entire interval**: Removing completely removes interval
5. **Query outside range**: Returns false if no interval covers query

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: Map-Based (Current Solution)**
- **Time**: O(k log n) per operation
- **Space**: O(n)
- **Best for**: Efficient interval management

### **Approach 2: Segment Tree**
- **Time**: O(log max_value) per operation
- **Space**: O(max_value)
- **Use case**: When range of values is limited

### **Approach 3: Balanced BST of Intervals**
- **Time**: O(k log n) per operation
- **Space**: O(n)
- **Similar**: Custom interval tree structure
