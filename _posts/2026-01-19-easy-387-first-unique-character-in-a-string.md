# [Easy] 387. First Unique Character in a String

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the **first non-repeating character** in it and return its **index**. If it does not exist, return `-1`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Explanation: The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not repeat.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The character 'v' at index 2 is the first character that does not repeat.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
Explanation: All characters repeat, so return -1.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Unique definition**: What makes a character unique? (Assumption: A character that appears exactly once in the string)

2. **Return value**: What should we return if no unique character exists? (Assumption: Return -1 - no unique character found)

3. **Case sensitivity**: Are characters case-sensitive? (Assumption: Based on constraints, only lowercase letters, so case doesn't matter)

4. **Index format**: Should we return 0-indexed or 1-indexed position? (Assumption: 0-indexed - standard array indexing)

5. **Character set**: What characters can appear in the string? (Assumption: Only lowercase English letters 'a'-'z' - 26 characters)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)**

For each character in the string, scan through the entire string to count how many times it appears. Return the index of the first character that appears exactly once. This approach has O(n²) time complexity where n is the string length, which is inefficient for large strings.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)**

Use a hash map or frequency array to count the frequency of each character in one pass. Then, iterate through the string again to find the first character with frequency 1. This reduces time complexity to O(n) with O(k) space where k is the number of unique characters (26 for lowercase letters). This works well but can be optimized further for space.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)**

Use bit manipulation to track character frequencies efficiently. Use two integers as bit masks: one to track characters that have appeared once, and another to track characters that have appeared multiple times. For each character, toggle its bit in the "once" mask. If the bit was already set, move it to the "multiple" mask. After processing, iterate through the string again and return the index of the first character whose bit is set in "once" but not in "multiple". This achieves O(n) time with O(1) space using only two integers, making it the most space-efficient solution.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires finding the first character that appears exactly once. There are several approaches:

1. **Bit Manipulation**: Use bitsets to track characters seen once vs multiple times
2. **Count Array**: Count occurrences, then find first character with count 1
3. **Hash Map**: Similar to count array but using hash map
4. **Two-Pass**: Count first, then scan for first unique

### Key Insights:

1. **Frequency Counting**: Track how many times each character appears
2. **Order Preservation**: Need to maintain order to find "first" unique
3. **Bit Manipulation**: Efficient way to track seen-once vs seen-multiple
4. **Early Exit**: Can optimize by tracking first occurrence indices

## Solution 1: Bit Manipulation (Efficient)

```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        once = 0
        multi = 0
        idx = -1

        for ch in s:
            bit = 1 << (ord(ch) - ord('a'))
            multi |= once & bit
            once ^= bit
            once &= ~multi

        for i in range(len(s)):
            bit = 1 << (ord(s[i]) - ord('a'))
            if once & bit:
                return i

        return -1
```

### Algorithm Explanation:

1. **Initialize Bitsets**:
   - `once`: Bits set for characters seen exactly once
   - `multi`: Bits set for characters seen multiple times

2. **First Pass - Track Frequencies**:
   - For each character, calculate its bit position: `bit = 1 << (ch - 'a')`
   - **Update `multi`**: `multi |= once & bit` - if character already in `once`, mark it in `multi`
   - **Toggle `once`**: `once ^= bit` - toggle the bit (XOR)
   - **Remove from `once`**: `once &= ~multi` - remove characters that appear multiple times

3. **Second Pass - Find First Unique**:
   - Scan string from start
   - Check if character's bit is set in `once`
   - Return first index where `once & bit` is true

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `s = "leetcode"`

```
First Pass:
  'l': bit = 1 << ('l' - 'a') = 1 << 11 = 2048
    multi |= once & 2048 = 0 (once is 0)
    once ^= 2048 → once = 2048
    once &= ~multi = 2048 & ~0 = 2048

  'e': bit = 1 << ('e' - 'a') = 1 << 4 = 16
    multi |= once & 16 = 0 (once doesn't have bit 16)
    once ^= 16 → once = 2048 | 16 = 2064
    once &= ~multi = 2064 & ~0 = 2064

  'e': bit = 16 (second 'e')
    multi |= once & 16 = 2064 & 16 = 16 → multi = 16
    once ^= 16 → once = 2048 (removed 'e')
    once &= ~multi = 2048 & ~16 = 2048

  ... continue for all characters ...

After first pass: once contains bits for characters seen exactly once

Second Pass:
  i=0, 'l': bit = 2048, once & 2048 = 2048 (set!) → return 0 ✓
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - First pass: O(n) to process all characters
  - Second pass: O(n) to find first unique
  - Total: O(n)

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Only two integers (`once` and `multi`) for bit manipulation
  - Constant space regardless of input size

## Solution 2: Count Array with Index Tracking

```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        cnt = [0] * 26
        idx = [-1] * 26

        for i in range(len(s)):
            curr = ord(s[i]) - ord('a')

            if cnt[curr] == 0:
                idx[curr] = i

            cnt[curr] += 1

        minIdx = float('inf')

        for i in range(26):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                minIdx = min(minIdx, idx[i])

        return -1 if minIdx == float('inf') else minIdx
```

### Algorithm Explanation:

1. **Initialize Arrays**:
   - `cnt[26]`: Count occurrences of each character
   - `idx[26]`: Store first occurrence index of each character

2. **First Pass - Count and Track Indices**:
   - For each character at index `i`:
     - Calculate character index: `curr = s[i] - 'a'`
     - If first time seeing character (`cnt[curr] == 0`), record index: `idx[curr] = i`
     - Increment count: `cnt[curr]++`

3. **Second Pass - Find Minimum Index**:
   - Iterate through all 26 characters
   - If character appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`):
     - Update minimum index: `minIdx = min(minIdx, idx[i])`
   - Return `minIdx` (or `-1` if no unique character)

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `s = "loveleetcode"`

```
First Pass:
  i=0, 'l': curr=11, cnt[11]=0 → idx[11]=0, cnt[11]=1
  i=1, 'o': curr=14, cnt[14]=0 → idx[14]=1, cnt[14]=1
  i=2, 'v': curr=21, cnt[21]=0 → idx[21]=2, cnt[21]=1
  i=3, 'e': curr=4, cnt[4]=0 → idx[4]=3, cnt[4]=1
  i=4, 'l': curr=11, cnt[11]=1 → skip idx update, cnt[11]=2
  i=5, 'e': curr=4, cnt[4]=1 → skip idx update, cnt[4]=2
  ... continue ...

After first pass:
  cnt: ['e'=4, 'l'=2, 'o'=1, 't'=1, 'c'=1, 'd'=1, 'v'=1, ...]
  idx: ['l'=0, 'o'=1, 'v'=2, 'e'=3, 't'=7, 'c'=8, 'd'=9, ...]

Second Pass:
  Check all 26 characters:
    'o': cnt[14]=1 → minIdx = min(INT_MAX, 1) = 1
    'v': cnt[21]=1 → minIdx = min(1, 2) = 1
    't': cnt[19]=1 → minIdx = min(1, 7) = 1
    'c': cnt[2]=1 → minIdx = min(1, 8) = 1
    'd': cnt[3]=1 → minIdx = min(1, 9) = 1

  But wait, 'v' appears at index 2, which is before 'o' at index 1...
  Actually, 'v' is at index 2, 'o' is at index 1, so 'o' comes first.
  Wait, let me recalculate: 'l'=0, 'o'=1, 'v'=2, so 'v' is at index 2.

  Actually, the correct answer should be 2 ('v'), but the algorithm finds 'o' at 1.
  Let me check: 'o' appears only once? Yes. So minIdx = 1.

  But the expected output is 2 for 'v'. Let me check the string again:
  "loveleetcode" - positions: l=0, o=1, v=2, e=3, l=4, e=5, e=6, t=7, c=8, o=9, d=10, e=11
  
  So 'o' appears at positions 1 and 9, so cnt['o'] = 2, not 1!
  'v' appears only at position 2, so cnt['v'] = 1, idx['v'] = 2.
  
  So minIdx should be 2 for 'v'. The algorithm is correct.
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - First pass: O(n) to count and track indices
  - Second pass: O(26) = O(1) to find minimum
  - Total: O(n)

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Two arrays of size 26 (constant)
  - O(1) space regardless of input size

## Key Insights

1. **Bit Manipulation**: Efficient way to track seen-once vs seen-multiple using XOR and AND operations
2. **Index Tracking**: Store first occurrence index to find minimum later
3. **Two-Pass Approach**: Count first, then find first unique
4. **Early Exit**: Can optimize by scanning string in second pass instead of all 26 characters

## Edge Cases

1. **All unique**: `s = "abc"` → return `0`
2. **All duplicate**: `s = "aabb"` → return `-1`
3. **Single character**: `s = "a"` → return `0`
4. **Unique at end**: `s = "aabbc"` → return `4`
5. **Unique in middle**: `s = "aabcc"` → return `2` ('b')
6. **Long string**: All characters unique, return `0`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong bit operations**: Incorrect XOR/AND logic in bit manipulation
2. **Index confusion**: Not tracking first occurrence correctly
3. **Off-by-one**: Incorrect character to index conversion
4. **Not handling all duplicates**: Forgetting to return `-1`
5. **Wrong order**: Returning last unique instead of first

## Alternative Approaches

### Simple Count Array (Standard)

```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        count = [0] * 26

        for c in s:
            count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if count[ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] == 1:
                return i

        return -1
```

**Pros**: Simple, clear, easy to understand  
**Cons**: Two passes through string (though still O(n))

### Hash Map Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        count = {}

        for c in s:
            if c in count:
                count[c] += 1
            else:
                count[c] = 1

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if count[s[i]] == 1:
                return i

        return -1
```

**Pros**: Works for any character set  
**Cons**: Slightly more overhead than array

## Comparison of Approaches

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Bit Manipulation** | O(n) | O(1) | Most space-efficient, elegant | Complex logic, harder to understand |
| **Count Array + Index** | O(n) | O(1) | Clear logic, tracks indices | Two arrays needed |
| **Simple Count Array** | O(n) | O(1) | Simplest, most readable | Two passes through string |
| **Hash Map** | O(n) | O(k) | Flexible, works for any charset | More overhead |

## When to Use Each Approach

- **Bit Manipulation**: When space optimization is critical, or demonstrating bit manipulation skills
- **Count Array + Index**: When you need to track both frequency and position efficiently
- **Simple Count Array**: When clarity and simplicity are priority (most common)
- **Hash Map**: When character set is unknown or not limited to lowercase letters
