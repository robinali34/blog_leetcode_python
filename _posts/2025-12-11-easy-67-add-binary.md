# [Easy] 67. Add Binary

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`
- `a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Binary addition**: What are the addition rules? (Assumption: Standard binary addition - 0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+1=10 (carry 1))

2. **Input format**: How are numbers represented? (Assumption: Binary strings - "101" represents 5 in decimal)

3. **Return format**: What should we return? (Assumption: Binary string representing sum of two binary numbers)

4. **Leading zeros**: Should we include leading zeros? (Assumption: No - per constraints, no leading zeros except for "0" itself)

5. **Carry handling**: How should we handle carry? (Assumption: Carry propagates from right to left - standard binary addition)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to add binary numbers. Let me convert to decimal, add, convert back."

**Naive Solution**: Convert both binary strings to integers, add them, convert result back to binary string.

**Complexity**: O(m + n) time, O(1) space

**Issues**:
- May overflow for large numbers
- Doesn't work for very long strings
- Not the intended approach
- Loses binary manipulation practice

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)
**Insight**: "I should add digit by digit from right to left, handling carry."

**Improved Solution**: Process strings from right to left. Add corresponding digits along with carry. Build result string from right to left, reverse at end.

**Complexity**: O(max(m, n)) time, O(max(m, n)) space

**Improvements**:
- Digit-by-digit addition is correct
- Handles carry properly
- Works with binary strings directly
- O(max(m, n)) time is optimal

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Digit-by-digit approach is optimal. Can optimize carry calculation."

**Best Solution**: Process from right to left, add digits with carry. Use (a + b + carry) % 2 for result digit, (a + b + carry) / 2 for new carry. Build result efficiently.

**Complexity**: O(max(m, n)) time, O(max(m, n)) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Digit-by-digit addition is correct approach
2. O(max(m, n)) time is optimal
3. Carry propagation is straightforward
4. Handle different string lengths naturally

## Solution 1: Optimized Single Pass (Recommended)

**Time Complexity:** O(max(m, n)) where m and n are lengths of a and b  
**Space Complexity:** O(max(m, n)) for the result string

This solution ensures the longer string is processed first, and uses a single carry variable that accumulates both digits efficiently.

```python
class Solution:
def addBinary(self, a, b):
    n = len(a), m = len(b)
    if n < m:
    return addBinary(b, a)
    str rtn
    carry = 0, j = m - 1
    for(i = n - 1 i >= 0 i -= 1) :
    if (a[i] == '1') carry += 1
    if(j >= 0  and  b[j -= 1] == '1') carry += 1
    ('1' if             rtn.append((carry % 2)  else '0'))
    carry /= 2
if carry == 1) rtn.append('1':
rtn.reverse()
return rtn
```

### How Solution 1 Works

1. **Ensure longer string first**: If `a` is shorter, swap to process longer string first
2. **Process from right to left**: Start from least significant bit (end of strings)
3. **Accumulate carry**: 
   - Add 1 to carry if current bit in `a` is '1'
   - Add 1 to carry if current bit in `b` is '1' (if available)
4. **Calculate result digit**: `carry % 2` gives the result bit (0 or 1)
5. **Update carry**: `carry /= 2` gives the new carry (0 or 1)
6. **Handle final carry**: If carry remains after processing all bits, add '1'
7. **Reverse result**: Since we built it from right to left, reverse to get correct order

### Key Insight

The carry variable accumulates both digits:
- `carry` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 (0+0, 0+1, 1+1, 1+1+carry)
- `carry % 2` gives the result bit
- `carry / 2` gives the new carry (always 0 or 1 for binary)

## Solution 2: Standard Two-Pointer Approach

**Time Complexity:** O(max(m, n))  
**Space Complexity:** O(max(m, n))

This is the more traditional approach that processes both strings simultaneously.

```python
class Solution:
def addBinary(self, a, b):
    str result
    i = a.length() - 1
    j = b.length() - 1
    carry = 0
    while i >= 0  or  j >= 0  or  carry:
        sum = carry
        if i >= 0:
            sum += a[i] - '0'
            i -= 1
        if j >= 0:
            sum += b[j] - '0'
            j -= 1
        result.append((sum % 2) + '0')
        carry = sum / 2
    result.reverse()
    return result
```

### How Solution 2 Works

1. **Two pointers**: `i` for string `a`, `j` for string `b`
2. **Process while either string has digits or carry exists**
3. **Calculate sum**: Add carry + digit from `a` (if available) + digit from `b` (if available)
4. **Append result**: `sum % 2` gives the bit, convert to character
5. **Update carry**: `sum / 2` gives the new carry
6. **Reverse result**: Built from right to left, so reverse at the end

## Solution 3: Using Built-in Conversion (Not Recommended for Interviews)

**Time Complexity:** O(max(m, n))  
**Space Complexity:** O(max(m, n))

This approach uses language built-ins to convert, add, and convert back. Not recommended for interviews but useful for quick solutions.

```python
class Solution:
def addBinary(self, a, b):
    // Convert binary strings to integers
    long long num1 = stoll(a, None, 2)
    long long num2 = stoll(b, None, 2)
    // Add and convert back to binary
    long long sum = num1 + num2
    if (sum == 0) return "0"
    str result
    while sum > 0:
        result.append((sum % 2) + '0')
        sum /= 2
    result.reverse()
    return result
```

**Note:** This approach has limitations:
- May overflow for very large binary strings (beyond `long long` range)
- Not suitable for interview settings where manual bit manipulation is expected
- Useful for quick prototyping or when constraints guarantee small inputs

## Solution 4: Bit Manipulation Style

**Time Complexity:** O(max(m, n))  
**Space Complexity:** O(max(m, n))

A variation that explicitly handles bit operations.

```python
class Solution:
def addBinary(self, a, b):
    str result
    i = len(a) - 1, j = len(b) - 1
    carry = 0
    while i >= 0  or  j >= 0  or  carry:
        ((a[i -= 1] - '0') if             bit1 = (i >= 0)  else 0)
        ((b[j -= 1] - '0') if             bit2 = (j >= 0)  else 0)
        sum = bit1 + bit2 + carry
        result.append((sum  1) + '0')  // sum % 2 using bitwise AND
        carry = sum >> 1  // sum / 2 using right shift
    result.reverse()
    return result
```

### Key Differences

- Uses bitwise AND (`& 1`) instead of modulo for getting the bit
- Uses right shift (`>> 1`) instead of division for carry
- More explicit about bit operations

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `a = "1010"`, `b = "1011"`

### Solution 1 (Optimized):
```
a = "1010" (longer, n=4)
b = "1011" (shorter, m=4, j=3)

i=3: a[3]='0', b[3]='1' → carry=1 → result='1', carry=0
i=2: a[2]='1', b[2]='1' → carry=2 → result='0', carry=1
i=1: a[1]='0', b[1]='0' → carry=1 → result='1', carry=0
i=0: a[0]='1', b[0]='1' → carry=2 → result='0', carry=1

Final carry=1 → result='1'
Reverse: "10101"
```

### Solution 2 (Standard):
```
a = "1010", b = "1011"
i=3, j=3, carry=0

Step 1: sum=0+0+1=1 → result='1', carry=0
Step 2: sum=0+1+1=2 → result='0', carry=1
Step 3: sum=1+0+0=1 → result='1', carry=0
Step 4: sum=1+1+0=2 → result='0', carry=1
Step 5: carry=1 → result='1'

Reverse: "10101"
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Solution | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Solution 1 (Optimized) | O(max(m,n)) | O(max(m,n)) | Ensures longer string processed first |
| Solution 2 (Standard) | O(max(m,n)) | O(max(m,n)) | Traditional two-pointer approach |
| Solution 3 (Built-in) | O(max(m,n)) | O(max(m,n)) | May overflow for large inputs |
| Solution 4 (Bitwise) | O(max(m,n)) | O(max(m,n)) | Explicit bit operations |

## Edge Cases

1. **Different lengths**: `"1" + "111"` → `"1000"`
2. **Carry at end**: `"1" + "1"` → `"10"`
3. **All zeros**: `"0" + "0"` → `"0"`
4. **One empty**: Not possible per constraints, but handled by `j >= 0` check
5. **Large strings**: Up to 10^4 characters each

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting final carry**: Not adding carry if it remains after processing all bits
2. **Wrong order**: Not reversing the result string
3. **Index out of bounds**: Not checking if pointers are valid before accessing
4. **Character conversion**: Forgetting to convert between char and int (`'0'` vs `0`)
5. **Carry calculation**: Using wrong formula for carry (should be `sum / 2` not `sum - 2`)

## Key Insights

1. **Binary addition rules**:
   - 0 + 0 = 0 (carry 0)
   - 0 + 1 = 1 (carry 0)
   - 1 + 1 = 0 (carry 1)
   - 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 (carry 1)

2. **Carry propagation**: Carry can only be 0 or 1 in binary addition

3. **String processing**: Process from right to left (least significant to most significant)

4. **Result building**: Build result backwards, then reverse

## Optimization Tips

1. **Pre-allocate space**: Can reserve `max(m, n) + 1` for result string
2. **Early termination**: If both strings exhausted and carry is 0, can break early
3. **In-place modification**: Could modify one string in-place, but not recommended for clarity
