# 752. Open the Lock

## Problem Statement

You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: `'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'`. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn `'9'` to be `'0'`, or `'0'` to be `'9'`. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at `'0000'`, a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a list of `deadends` dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a `target` representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or `-1` if it is impossible.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
Output: 6
Explanation:
A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the deadend "0102".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
Output: 1
Explanation: We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: deadends = ["8887","8889","8878","8898","8788","8988","7888","9888"], target = "8888"
Output: -1
Explanation: We cannot reach the target without getting stuck in a deadend.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= deadends.length <= 500`
- `deadends[i].length == 4`
- `target.length == 4`
- target and deadends[i] consist of digits only.

## Solution Approach

This is a **shortest path problem** that can be solved using **BFS**. We need to find the minimum number of moves to reach the target from "0000" while avoiding deadends.

### Key Insights:

1. **State space**: Each lock state is a 4-digit string (0000-9999)
2. **Transitions**: For each position, we can turn up (+1) or down (-1)
3. **Shortest path**: BFS guarantees minimum number of moves
4. **Deadends**: Act as obstacles that block certain states
5. **Wrapping**: 9 → 0 and 0 → 9 (circular nature)

### Algorithm:

1. **BFS from "0000"**: Use queue to explore all possible states
2. **Level-by-level**: Each level represents one move
3. **State transitions**: Generate all 8 possible next states (4 positions × 2 directions)
4. **Avoid deadends**: Skip states that are in deadends set
5. **Visited tracking**: Prevent revisiting states

## Solution

### **Solution: BFS Shortest Path**

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: list[str], target: str) -> int:
        deads = set(deadends)
        visited = set()
        if "0000" in deads:
            return -1
        q = deque(["0000"])
        visited.add("0000")
        steps = 0
        while q:
            size = len(q)
            for _ in range(size):
                curr = q.popleft()
                if curr == target:
                    return steps
                for i in range(4):
                    for dir in [-1, 1]:
                        next_state = list(curr)
                        next_state[i] = str((int(curr[i]) + dir + 10) % 10)
                        next_str = ''.join(next_state)
                        if next_str not in deads and next_str not in visited:
                            q.append(next_str)
                            visited.add(next_str)
                steps += 1
        return -1
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Initialize**: Create deadends set and visited set
2. **Check start**: If "0000" is a deadend, return -1 immediately
3. **BFS setup**: Start with "0000" in queue
4. **Level processing**: Process all states at current level
5. **State transitions**: For each position, try both directions (+1 and -1)
6. **Wrapping**: Use modulo arithmetic for circular nature
7. **Validation**: Check if next state is valid (not deadend, not visited)
8. **Target check**: Return steps when target is reached

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"`:**

```
Level 0: ["0000"] → steps = 0
Level 1: ["1000", "9000", "0100", "0900", "0010", "0090", "0001", "0009"] → steps = 1
Level 2: ["2000", "1100", "1900", "0200", "0800", "0110", "0190", "0020", "0080", "0011", "0019", "0002", "0008"] → steps = 2
Level 3: Continue exploring...
...
Level 6: ["0202"] → Found target! Return 6

Path: "0000" → "1000" → "1100" → "1200" → "1201" → "1202" → "0202"
```

### **Key Implementation Details:**

```python
// Circular wrapping for digits
next[i] = (curr[i] - '0' + dir + 10) % 10 + '0';

// For dir = -1: (0 - 1 + 10) % 10 = 9 (0 → 9)
// For dir = +1: (9 + 1 + 10) % 10 = 0 (9 → 0)
```

## Complexity Analysis

### **Time Complexity:** O(10^4) = O(1)
- **State space**: At most 10,000 states (0000-9999)
- **BFS traversal**: Each state visited at most once
- **Transitions**: 8 transitions per state
- **Total**: O(10,000 × 8) = O(80,000) = O(1) constant time

### **Space Complexity:** O(10^4) = O(1)
- **Queue**: O(10,000) - maximum states in queue
- **Visited set**: O(10,000) - stores visited states
- **Deadends set**: O(500) - stores deadend states
- **Total**: O(10,000) = O(1) constant space

## Key Points

1. **BFS for shortest path**: Guarantees minimum number of moves
2. **State space**: 4-digit strings represent lock states
3. **Circular wrapping**: Handle 0 ↔ 9 transitions correctly
4. **Deadend avoidance**: Skip invalid states
5. **Visited tracking**: Prevent infinite loops
6. **Level counting**: Each BFS level represents one move

## Alternative Approaches

### **Bidirectional BFS**
```python
class Solution:

    def openLock(self, deadends: list[str], target: str) -> int:
        deads = set(deadends)
        if "0000" in deads or target in deads:
            return -1
        
        begin, end, visited = {"0000"}, {target}, set()
        steps = 0
        
        while begin and end:
            if len(begin) > len(end):
                begin, end = end, begin
            
            next_level = set()
            for curr in begin:
                if curr in end:
                    return steps
                if curr in deads or curr in visited:
                    continue
                
                visited.add(curr)
                curr_list = list(curr)
                for i in range(4):
                    for dir in [-1, 1]:
                        next_state = curr_list[:]
                        next_state[i] = str((int(curr[i]) + dir + 10) % 10)
                        next_str = ''.join(next_state)
                        if next_str not in deads and next_str not in visited:
                            next_level.add(next_str)
            begin = next_level
            steps += 1
        return -1
```
