# [Medium] 921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid

A parentheses string is valid if and only if:

- It is the empty string,
- It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
- It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.

You are given a parentheses string `s`. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.

- For example, if `s = "()))"`, you can insert an opening parenthesis to be `"(()))"` or a closing parenthesis to be `"())))"`.

Return *the minimum number of moves required to make `s` valid*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "())"
Output: 1
Explanation: Insert '(' at the beginning: "()())"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "((("
Output: 3
Explanation: Insert ')' at the end: "((()))"
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "()))(("
Output: 4
Explanation: Need to add 2 '(' at the beginning and 2 ')' at the end
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'('` or `')'`.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Valid parentheses**: What makes parentheses valid? (Assumption: Every opening '(' has matching closing ')', properly nested)

2. **Optimization goal**: What are we optimizing for? (Assumption: Minimum number of parentheses to add to make string valid)

3. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - minimum number of parentheses to add)

4. **Insertion positions**: Where can we add parentheses? (Assumption: Can add at any position - beginning, middle, or end)

5. **Parentheses types**: What types of parentheses? (Assumption: Only '(' and ')' - no brackets or braces)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Try adding different combinations of parentheses and check if the resulting string is valid. This requires trying all possible ways to add parentheses, which has exponential complexity. For each combination, validate the parentheses string, which takes O(n) time. This is too slow for large strings.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use a stack to identify unmatched parentheses. Track opening and closing parentheses: if we encounter ')' without a matching '(', we need to add '('. If we finish with unmatched '(', we need to add ')'. Count unmatched opening and closing parentheses. However, determining the minimum additions requires careful tracking.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use a balance counter: traverse the string, increment balance for '(', decrement for ')'. If balance becomes negative (more ')' than '('), we need to add '(', so increment a counter and reset balance to 0. After processing, add balance number of ')' to close remaining '(' parentheses. The answer is the sum of additions needed. This achieves O(n) time with O(1) space, which is optimal. The key insight is that we only need to track the balance (net opening parentheses) and handle negative balance (excess closing parentheses) immediately.

## Solution: Greedy Counter Approach

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

Use counters to track unmatched opening and closing parentheses. When we see a closing parenthesis, match it with an existing opening if possible, otherwise we need to add an opening parenthesis. At the end, add closing parentheses for any remaining unmatched opening parentheses.

```python
class Solution:
def minAddToMakeValid(self, s):
    left = 0, right = 0
    for ch in s:
        if ch == '(':
            left += 1
             else if (ch == ')') :
            if left > 0:
                left -= 1
                 else :
                right += 1
    return left + right
```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Key Insight: Balance Tracking

- **`left`**: Counts unmatched opening parentheses
- **`right`**: Counts unmatched closing parentheses (need to add opening parentheses)
- **Greedy approach**: Match closing parentheses immediately when possible

### Step-by-Step Example: `s = "()))(("`

| Step | Char | `left` | `right` | Action | Reason |
|------|------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Initial | - | 0 | 0 | - | - |
| 1 | `(` | 1 | 0 | Increment `left` | New opening |
| 2 | `)` | 0 | 0 | Decrement `left` | Matched with existing `(` |
| 3 | `)` | 0 | 1 | Increment `right` | No `(` to match, need to add one |
| 4 | `)` | 0 | 2 | Increment `right` | No `(` to match, need to add one |
| 5 | `(` | 1 | 2 | Increment `left` | New opening |
| 6 | `(` | 2 | 2 | Increment `left` | New opening |

**Final:** `right = 2` (need to add 2 `(`), `left = 2` (need to add 2 `)`)  
**Total:** `2 + 2 = 4`

### Visual Representation

```
s = "()))(("
     ( ) ) ) ( (
     0 1 2 3 4 5
     
Step 1: '(' → left = 1
  Need: 1 '(' unmatched
  
Step 2: ')' → left = 0
  Matched! Now balanced
  
Step 3: ')' → right = 1
  No '(' to match → need to add 1 '('
  
Step 4: ')' → right = 2
  No '(' to match → need to add 1 '('
  
Step 5: '(' → left = 1
  Need: 1 '(' unmatched
  
Step 6: '(' → left = 2
  Need: 2 '(' unmatched → need to add 2 ')'

Final: right = 2 (add '('), left = 2 (add ')')
Total: 4 additions
```

## Key Insights

1. **Counter-Based**: Use counters instead of stack for single bracket type
2. **Greedy Matching**: Match closing parentheses immediately when possible
3. **Two Types of Deficits**:
   - **Unmatched closing**: Tracked by `right` (need to add opening)
   - **Unmatched opening**: Tracked by `left` (need to add closing)
4. **Final Answer**: Sum of both deficits (`left + right`)

## Algorithm Breakdown

### 1. Initialize Counters
```python
left = 0, right = 0
```
- **`left`**: Tracks unmatched opening parentheses
- **`right`**: Tracks unmatched closing parentheses (need to add opening)

### 2. Process Opening Parentheses
```python
if ch == '(':
    left += 1
```
- Increment `left` counter
- This represents an opening that needs to be closed later

### 3. Process Closing Parentheses
```python
def if(self, ')'):
    if left > 0:
        left -= 1
         else :
        right += 1
```
- **If `left > 0`**: Match with existing opening → decrement `left`
- **If `left == 0`**: No opening to match → increment `right` (need to add an opening)

### 4. Calculate Final Answer
```python
return left + right
```
- **`right`**: Number of opening parentheses to add (for unmatched closing)
- **`left`**: Number of closing parentheses to add (for unmatched opening)
- **Sum**: Total minimum additions needed

## Complexity Analysis

| Aspect | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| **Time** | O(n) - Single pass through string |
| **Space** | O(1) - Only using two integer variables |

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 1: Stack-Based (More Verbose)

```python
def minAddToMakeValid(self, s):
    list[char> st
    minAdd = 0
    for c in s:
        if c == '(':
            st.push(c)
             else :
            if not st:
                minAdd += 1  // Need to add '('
                 else :
                st.pop()  // Match found
    return minAdd + len(st)  // Add ')' for remaining '('
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - Stack can hold up to n elements

### Approach 2: Stack-Based (More Verbose)

```python
def minAddToMakeValid(self, s):
    list[char> st
    right = 0
    for c in s:
        if c == '(':
            st.push(c)
             else :
            if not st:
                right += 1  // Need to add '('
                 else :
                st.pop()  // Match found
    return right + len(st)  // Add ')' for remaining '('
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - Stack can hold up to n elements

**Note:** This approach uses a stack, which is more memory-intensive than the counter approach.

### Approach 3: Dynamic Programming (Overkill)

```python
// Not recommended for this problem
// DP would be O(n²) time and space
```

## Comparison of Approaches

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Counter (Greedy)** | O(n) | O(1) | Optimal, simple | Only works for single bracket type |
| **Stack** | O(n) | O(n) | Extensible to multiple types | More memory, slower |
| **Two-Pass** | O(n) | O(1) | Clear separation | Same as counter approach |

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty string**: `""` → `0` (already valid)
2. **All opening**: `"((("` → `3` (need 3 closing)
3. **All closing**: `")))"` → `3` (need 3 opening)
4. **Already valid**: `"()()"` → `0`
5. **Nested valid**: `"((()))"` → `0`
6. **Mixed**: `"()))(("` → `4` (2 opening + 2 closing)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Only tracking one type**: Forgetting to add `left` at the end
2. **Wrong condition**: Using `left >= 0` instead of `left > 0`
3. **Not greedy**: Trying to optimize placement instead of just counting
4. **Off-by-one errors**: In length calculations

## Detailed Example Walkthrough

### Example 1: `s = "())"`

```
Step 0: Initialize
  left = 0
  right = 0

Step 1: ch = '('
  Opening → left = 1
  State: left=1, right=0

Step 2: ch = ')'
  Closing → left > 0? Yes → left = 0
  State: left=0, right=0

Step 3: ch = ')'
  Closing → left > 0? No → right = 1
  State: left=0, right=1

Final: left + right = 0 + 1 = 1 ✓
```

### Example 2: `s = "((("`

```
Step 0: Initialize
  left = 0
  right = 0

Step 1: ch = '('
  Opening → left = 1
  State: left=1, right=0

Step 2: ch = '('
  Opening → left = 2
  State: left=2, right=0

Step 3: ch = '('
  Opening → left = 3
  State: left=3, right=0

Final: left + right = 3 + 0 = 3 ✓
```

### Example 3: `s = "()))(("`

```
Step 0: Initialize
  left = 0
  right = 0

Step 1: ch = '('
  Opening → left = 1
  State: left=1, right=0

Step 2: ch = ')'
  Closing → left > 0? Yes → left = 0
  State: left=0, right=0

Step 3: ch = ')'
  Closing → left > 0? No → right = 1
  State: left=0, right=1

Step 4: ch = ')'
  Closing → left > 0? No → right = 2
  State: left=0, right=2

Step 5: ch = '('
  Opening → left = 1
  State: left=1, right=2

Step 6: ch = '('
  Opening → left = 2
  State: left=2, right=2

Final: left + right = 2 + 2 = 4 ✓
```

## Why This Greedy Approach Works

### Optimal Substructure

The problem has optimal substructure:
- Making a prefix valid doesn't affect the optimal solution for the suffix
- We can greedily match parentheses as we go

### Mathematical Proof

**Claim:** The greedy approach (match immediately when possible) gives the minimum additions.

**Proof:**
1. If we have `(` and see `)`, matching immediately is optimal
   - Delaying would require adding a `)` later, which is at least as costly
2. If we see `)` with no `(` to match, we must add a `(`
   - Adding it now is as good as adding it later
3. Remaining unmatched `(` must be closed
   - No way to avoid adding `)` for each remaining `(`

Therefore, the greedy approach is optimal.

## Visualization of Different Cases

### Case 1: Unmatched Closing
```
s = ")))"
     ↑
   Need to add '(' here (or before)

Additions: 3 '('
```

### Case 2: Unmatched Opening
```
s = "((("
        ↑
      Need to add ')' here (or after)

Additions: 3 ')'
```

### Case 3: Mixed
```
s = "()))(("
     ( ) ) ) ( (
     0 1 2 3 4 5
     
Unmatched closing: positions 2, 3 → need 2 '('
Unmatched opening: positions 4, 5 → need 2 ')'

Additions: 2 '(' + 2 ')' = 4
```

## Optimization Tips

### Early Exit (Not Applicable)
We need to process the entire string to count all unmatched parentheses.

### Memory Optimization
Already optimal - O(1) space. The counter approach is the most memory-efficient.

### Branch Optimization
The ternary operator `open > 0 ? open-- : minAdd++` is efficient and clear.

## Pattern Recognition

This problem demonstrates the **Greedy Counter Pattern**:
- Use counter instead of stack for single bracket type
- Track unmatched opening and closing separately
- Greedily match whenever possible
- Sum remaining unmatched counts

**Key Insight:**
- For single bracket type: counter is simpler and more efficient than stack
- Track two types of deficits separately
- Greedy matching is optimal

**Applications:**
- Parentheses balancing
- Bracket counting
- Expression validation
- Simple matching problems

## Extension: Multiple Bracket Types

If we had multiple bracket types like `()[]{}`, we'd need a stack:

```python
def minAddToMakeValid(self, s):
    list[char> st
    minAdd = 0
    for c in s:
        if c == '('  or  c == '['  or  c == '{':
            st.push(c)
             else :
            if not st:
                minAdd += 1  // Need to add opening
                 else :
                char top = st.top()
                if((c == ')'  and  top == '(')  or
                (c == ']'  and  top == '[')  or
                (c == ''  and  top == ':')) :
                st.pop()
                 else :
                minAdd += 1  // Mismatch, need to add opening
return minAdd + len(st)  // Add closing for remaining
```

But for single bracket type `()`, the counter approach is optimal.

## Code Quality Notes

1. **Readability**: Clear variable names (`open`, `minAdd`)
2. **Efficiency**: Optimal O(n) time, O(1) space
3. **Correctness**: Handles all edge cases properly
4. **Simplicity**: Much simpler than stack-based approach for single type

## Comparison with Similar Problems

| Problem | Approach | Complexity |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **LC 20** (Check valid) | Stack | O(n) time, O(n) space |
| **LC 921** (Min add) | Counter | O(n) time, O(1) space |
| **LC 1249** (Min remove) | Stack | O(n) time, O(n) space |
| **LC 1541** (Min insertions) | Counter | O(n) time, O(1) space |

**Key Difference:**
- **Single bracket type** (`()`) → Counter is optimal
- **Multiple bracket types** (`()[]{}`) → Stack is needed

*This problem demonstrates how a simple counter-based approach can be more efficient than a stack when dealing with a single bracket type. The greedy strategy of matching immediately ensures optimality.*
