# [Medium] 227. Basic Calculator II

Given a string `s` which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`.

**Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "3+2*2"
Output: 7
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = " 3/2 "
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5`
- `s` consists of integers and operators `('+', '-', '*', '/')` separated by some number of spaces.
- `s` represents a valid expression.
- All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range `[0, 2^31 - 1]`.
- The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Expression format**: What operations are supported? (Assumption: Addition '+', subtraction '-', multiplication '*', division '/' - no parentheses)

2. **Operator precedence**: What is the precedence? (Assumption: Standard - multiplication and division before addition and subtraction)

3. **Division handling**: How should division be handled? (Assumption: Integer division - truncate toward zero)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer result of evaluating the expression)

5. **Whitespace**: Should we ignore whitespace? (Assumption: Yes - spaces can be ignored)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to evaluate expression. Let me parse and compute manually."

**Naive Solution**: Parse expression, convert to postfix notation, evaluate using stack.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- Two-pass approach (infix to postfix, then evaluate)
- More complex than needed
- Doesn't leverage operator precedence directly
- Can be optimized

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can use stack to handle operator precedence. Process * and / immediately, + and - later."

**Improved Solution**: Use stack to store numbers. When encountering * or /, pop and compute immediately. When + or -, push number with sign. At end, sum all numbers in stack.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- Handles operator precedence correctly
- Single pass through expression
- Stack enables correct evaluation order
- Can optimize space

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Can optimize to O(1) space by processing * and / immediately, tracking running sum."

**Best Solution**: Process * and / immediately, maintain running sum for + and -. Use variables to track current number and last number. This achieves O(1) space.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(1) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Process high-precedence operators immediately
2. O(n) time is optimal - single pass
3. O(1) space is possible with careful tracking
4. Stack alternative uses O(n) space but is clearer

## Solution 1: Stack-Based Approach

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Use a stack to store numbers. When encountering `+` or `-`, push the number (with sign for `-`). When encountering `*` or `/`, immediately compute with the top of stack and push the result. Finally, sum all elements in the stack.

```python
class Solution:
def calculate(self, s):
    len = s.length()
    if(len == 0) return 0
    list[int> stk
    char operation = '+'
    curr = 0
    for(i = 0 i < len i += 1) :
    char ch = s[i]
    if isdigit(ch):
        curr = (curr  10) + (ch - '0')
    if not isdigit(ch)  and  not isspace(ch)  or  i == len - 1:
        if operation == '-':
            stk.push(-curr)
             else if(operation == '+') :
            stk.push(curr)
             else if(operation == '') :
            stkTop = stk.top()
            stk.pop()
            stk.push(stkTop  curr)
             else if(operation == '/') :
            stkTop = stk.top()
            stk.pop()
            stk.push(stkTop / curr)
        operation = ch
        curr = 0
rtn = 0
while not not stk:
    rtn += stk.top()
    stk.pop()
return rtn

```

## Solution 2: Optimized Without Stack

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

Instead of using a stack, use variables to track the last value and current result. This avoids the need for a stack since we process `*` and `/` immediately and only need to remember the last value for `+` and `-`.

```python
class Solution:
def calculate(self, s):
    len = s.length()
    if (len == 0) return 0
    curr = 0, last = 0, rtn = 0
    char sign = '+'
    for(i = 0 i < len i += 1) :
    char ch = s[i]
    if isdigit(ch):
        curr = (curr  10) + (ch - '0')
    if not isdigit(ch)  and  not isspace(ch)  or  i == len - 1:
        if sign == '+'  or  sign == '-':
            rtn += last
            (curr if                     last = (sign == '+')  else -curr)
             else if(sign == '') :
            last = last  curr
             else if(sign == '/') :
            last = last / curr
        sign = ch
        curr = 0
rtn += last
return rtn

```

## How the Algorithms Work

### Key Insight: Operator Precedence

- **`*` and `/`**: Higher precedence - must be evaluated immediately
- **`+` and `-`**: Lower precedence - can be deferred until the end

### Solution 1: Stack-Based Step-by-Step

**Example:** `s = "3+2*2"`

| Step | Char | `curr` | `operation` | Stack | Action |
|------|------|--------|-------------|-------|--------|
| 0 | - | 0 | '+' | [] | Initialize |
| 1 | '3' | 3 | '+' | [] | Build number |
| 2 | '+' | 0 | '+' | [3] | Push 3, set op |
| 3 | '2' | 2 | '+' | [3] | Build number |
| 4 | '*' | 0 | '*' | [3] | Set op to * |
| 5 | '2' | 2 | '*' | [3] | Build number |
| 6 | End | 0 | - | [3, 4] | Pop 3, calc 3*2=4, push 4 |
| Final | - | - | - | [3, 4] | Sum: 3+4=7 |

**Visual Representation:**
```
"3+2*2"
 3 + 2 * 2
 ↑   ↑   ↑
 |   |   |
 |   |   Process: 2*2 = 4, push 4
 |   |
 |   Push: 3
 |
 Sum all: 3 + 4 = 7
```

### Solution 2: Optimized Step-by-Step

**Example:** `s = "3+2*2"`

| Step | Char | `curr` | `sign` | `last` | `rtn` | Action |
|------|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 0 | - | 0 | '+' | 0 | 0 | Initialize |
| 1 | '3' | 3 | '+' | 0 | 0 | Build number |
| 2 | '+' | 0 | '+' | 3 | 0 | Add last to rtn, set last=3 |
| 3 | '2' | 2 | '+' | 3 | 0 | Build number |
| 4 | '*' | 0 | '*' | 3 | 0 | Set sign to * |
| 5 | '2' | 2 | '*' | 6 | 0 | Build number, calc last=3*2=6 |
| 6 | End | 0 | - | 6 | 0 | Add last to rtn: 0+6=6 |

Wait, let me recalculate:

Actually, at step 2 (when we see '+'), we should:
- `rtn += last` → `rtn = 0 + 0 = 0`
- `last = (sign == '+') ? curr : -curr` → `last = 3`

At step 5 (when we see '2' and sign is '*'):
- We process the previous sign '*'
- `last = last * curr` → `last = 3 * 2 = 6`

At the end:
- `rtn += last` → `rtn = 0 + 6 = 6`

But the answer should be 7, not 6. Let me trace more carefully:

Actually, the issue is that when we see the operator, we need to process the previous operator. Let me trace correctly:

```
"3+2*2"
 i=0: '3' → curr = 3
 i=1: '+' → process '+' with curr=3
        sign was '+', so rtn += last (0), last = 3
        sign = '+', curr = 0
 i=2: '2' → curr = 2
 i=3: '*' → process '*' with curr=2
        sign was '*', so last = last * curr = 3 * 2 = 6
        sign = '*', curr = 0
 i=4: '2' → curr = 2
 i=5: end → process '*' with curr=2
        sign was '*', so last = last * curr = 6 * 2 = 12
        Then rtn += last = 0 + 12 = 12
```

This is still wrong. The issue is that we're processing the operator when we see the NEXT operator or end. Let me look at the code again:

```python
if not isdigit(ch)  and  not isspace(ch)  or  i == len - 1:
    # Process previous operation
    if sign == '+'  or  sign == '-':
        rtn += last
        (curr if         last = (sign == '+')  else -curr)
         else if(sign == '') :
        last = last  curr
         else if(sign == '/') :
        last = last / curr
    sign = ch  # Update sign for next operation
    curr = 0

```

I see - when we see an operator, we process the PREVIOUS operator with the current number. Let me trace again:

```
"3+2*2"
 i=0: '3' → curr = 3
 i=1: '+' → process previous sign '+' with curr=3
        sign was '+' (initial), so rtn += last (0), last = 3
        sign = '+', curr = 0
 i=2: '2' → curr = 2
 i=3: '*' → process previous sign '+' with curr=2
        sign was '+', so rtn += last (3), last = 2
        sign = '*', curr = 0
 i=4: '2' → curr = 2
 i=5: end → process previous sign '*' with curr=2
        sign was '*', so last = last * curr = 2 * 2 = 4
        Then rtn += last = 3 + 4 = 7 ✓
```

Yes! That's correct now.

## Key Insights

1. **Operator Precedence**: `*` and `/` have higher precedence than `+` and `-`
2. **Immediate Evaluation**: Evaluate `*` and `/` immediately when encountered
3. **Deferred Evaluation**: Defer `+` and `-` until the end
4. **Number Building**: Build multi-digit numbers by `curr = curr * 10 + digit`
5. **Sign Handling**: For `-`, push negative number or set `last` to negative

## Algorithm Breakdown

### Solution 1: Stack-Based

#### 1. Build Numbers
```python
if isdigit(ch):
    curr = (curr  10) + (ch - '0')

```
- Accumulate digits to form multi-digit numbers

#### 2. Process Operators
```python
if not isdigit(ch)  and  not isspace(ch)  or  i == len - 1:
    if operation == '-':
        stk.push(-curr)  # Push negative for subtraction
         else if(operation == '+') :
        stk.push(curr)
         else if(operation == '') :
        stkTop = stk.top()
        stk.pop()
        stk.push(stkTop  curr)  # Immediate evaluation
         else if(operation == '/') :
        stkTop = stk.top()
        stk.pop()
        stk.push(stkTop / curr)  # Immediate evaluation
    operation = ch
    curr = 0

```

#### 3. Sum Stack
```python
rtn = 0
while not not stk:
    rtn += stk.top()
    stk.pop()




```

### Solution 2: Optimized

#### 1. Track Last Value
```python
curr = 0, last = 0, rtn = 0
char sign = '+'

```
- **`last`**: Stores the value that might be multiplied/divided
- **`rtn`**: Accumulates final result

#### 2. Process Operators
```python
if sign == '+'  or  sign == '-':
    rtn += last  # Add previous last to result
    (curr if     last = (sign == '+')  else -curr  # Set new last)
     else if(sign == '') :
    last = last  curr  # Immediate evaluation
     else if(sign == '/') :
    last = last / curr  # Immediate evaluation

```

#### 3. Final Addition
```python
rtn += last  # Add remaining last value


```

## Complexity Analysis

| Solution | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Stack-Based** | O(n) | O(n) | Clear logic, uses stack |
| **Optimized** | O(n) | O(1) | No stack needed |

## Why Solution 2 Works

### Key Observation

For expressions like `a + b * c`:
- We can't evaluate `a + b` first (wrong precedence)
- We evaluate `b * c` first, then add to `a`
- So we keep `a` separate and combine `b * c` immediately

### Variable Roles

- **`last`**: Holds the value that's part of a `*` or `/` chain, or a single `+`/`-` operand
- **`rtn`**: Accumulates values that are completely processed (added/subtracted)

### Example: `"3+2*2"`

```
Step 1: Process '3' with sign '+'
  rtn += last (0) → rtn = 0
  last = 3

Step 2: Process '2' with sign '*'
  last = last * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6

Step 3: End, process with sign '*'
  last = last * 2 = 6 * 2 = 12
  rtn += last = 0 + 12 = 12
```

Wait, that's still wrong. Let me re-read the code logic:

Actually, when we see an operator, we process the PREVIOUS operator. So:

```
"3+2*2"
 i=0: '3' → curr=3
 i=1: '+' → process sign='+' (initial) with curr=3
        rtn += last (0), last = 3, sign='+', curr=0
 i=2: '2' → curr=2
 i=3: '*' → process sign='+' with curr=2
        rtn += last (3), last = 2, sign='*', curr=0
 i=4: '2' → curr=2
 i=5: end → process sign='*' with curr=2
        last = last * curr = 2 * 2 = 4
        rtn += last = 3 + 4 = 7 ✓
```

Perfect!

## Edge Cases

1. **Single number**: `"42"` → `42`
2. **Only spaces**: `"   "` → `0` (handled by initial check)
3. **Division truncation**: `"3/2"` → `1` (not 1.5)
4. **Negative results**: `"1-2"` → `-1`
5. **Multiple spaces**: `"3  +  2"` → `5` (spaces are ignored)
6. **Consecutive operators**: Not possible (given expression is valid)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong operator precedence**: Evaluating `+` before `*`
2. **Number building**: Not handling multi-digit numbers correctly
3. **Sign handling**: Forgetting to push negative for `-` or set `last` negative
4. **End of string**: Not processing the last number when string ends
5. **Division truncation**: Using floating point instead of integer division

## Detailed Example Walkthrough

### Example: `s = " 3+5 / 2 "`

**Solution 1 (Stack):**

```
Step 0: Initialize
  stk = []
  operation = '+'
  curr = 0

Step 1-2: ' 3' → curr = 3
Step 3: '+' → process operation='+' with curr=3
  stk.push(3)
  operation = '+', curr = 0
  stk = [3]

Step 4-5: ' 5' → curr = 5
Step 6: ' ' → skip
Step 7: '/' → process operation='+' with curr=5
  stk.push(5)
  operation = '/', curr = 0
  stk = [3, 5]

Step 8: ' ' → skip
Step 9: '2' → curr = 2
Step 10: ' ' → skip
Step 11: end → process operation='/' with curr=2
  top = 5, stk.pop()
  stk.push(5 / 2) = stk.push(2)
  stk = [3, 2]

Final: Sum stack = 3 + 2 = 5 ✓
```

**Solution 2 (Optimized):**

```
Step 0: Initialize
  curr = 0, last = 0, rtn = 0
  sign = '+'

Step 1-2: ' 3' → curr = 3
Step 3: '+' → process sign='+' with curr=3
  rtn += last (0) → rtn = 0
  last = 3
  sign = '+', curr = 0

Step 4-5: ' 5' → curr = 5
Step 6: ' ' → skip
Step 7: '/' → process sign='+' with curr=5
  rtn += last (3) → rtn = 3
  last = 5
  sign = '/', curr = 0

Step 8: ' ' → skip
Step 9: '2' → curr = 2
Step 10: ' ' → skip
Step 11: end → process sign='/' with curr=2
  last = last / curr = 5 / 2 = 2
  rtn += last = 3 + 2 = 5 ✓
```
