# [Easy] 203. Remove Linked List Elements

Given the `head` of a linked list and an integer `val`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has `Node.val == val`, and return *the new head*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 50`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Removal operation**: What does "remove" mean? (Assumption: Remove all nodes with value equal to val from the linked list)

2. **In-place requirement**: Should we remove in-place? (Assumption: Yes - modify pointers, not create new list)

3. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Head of modified linked list - may be different if head was removed)

4. **Empty list**: What if list is empty? (Assumption: Return nullptr - no nodes to process)

5. **All nodes removed**: What if all nodes have value val? (Assumption: Return nullptr - empty list after removal)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to remove nodes. Let me traverse and remove nodes with matching value."

**Naive Solution**: Traverse list, when finding node with val, remove it by updating previous node's next pointer.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(1) space

**Issues**:
- Need to handle head removal specially
- Complex pointer manipulation
- Error-prone edge cases
- Can be simplified

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can use dummy node to simplify head removal handling."

**Improved Solution**: Use dummy node before head. Traverse list, remove nodes with val by updating pointers. Dummy node handles head removal uniformly.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(1) space

**Improvements**:
- Dummy node simplifies logic
- Handles head removal uniformly
- Cleaner code
- O(1) space is optimal

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Dummy node approach is optimal. Can also use recursive approach."

**Best Solution**: Dummy node approach is optimal. Dummy node eliminates special case for head removal. Traverse and remove nodes with val.

**Complexity**: O(n) time, O(1) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Dummy node is key technique for linked list problems
2. O(n) time is optimal - must visit each node
3. O(1) space is optimal
4. Handles all edge cases elegantly

## Solution: Dummy Node Approach

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We visit each node once  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only using constant extra space

The key insight is to use a dummy node to handle edge cases where the head itself needs to be removed. We traverse the list with two pointers: `prev` (previous node) and `curr` (current node), removing nodes that match the target value.

### Solution: Iterative with Dummy Node

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head, val):
        if head == None:
            return head

        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        prev = dummy
        curr = head
        toDelete = None

        while curr != None:
            if curr.val == val:
                prev.next = curr.next
                toDelete = curr
            else:
                prev = curr

            curr = curr.next

            # Python does not need manual delete (kept for syntax consistency)
            if toDelete != None:
                toDelete = None

        ret = dummy.next
        return ret
```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Step-by-Step Example: `head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6]`, `val = 6`

```
Initial:  dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> nullptr
          ↑       ↑
         prev    curr

Step 1:   curr->val = 1 ≠ 6, move prev forward
          dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> nullptr
                  ↑    ↑
                 prev curr

Step 2:   curr->val = 2 ≠ 6, move prev forward
          dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> nullptr
                       ↑    ↑
                      prev curr

Step 3:   curr->val = 6 == 6, remove node
          prev->next = curr->next (skip 6)
          delete curr
          dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> nullptr
                       ↑    ↑
                      prev curr

Step 4:   curr->val = 3 ≠ 6, move prev forward
          dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> nullptr
                            ↑    ↑
                           prev curr

Step 5:   curr->val = 4 ≠ 6, move prev forward
          dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> nullptr
                                 ↑    ↑
                                prev curr

Step 6:   curr->val = 5 ≠ 6, move prev forward
          dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> nullptr
                                      ↑    ↑
                                     prev curr

Step 7:   curr->val = 6 == 6, remove node
          prev->next = curr->next (skip 6)
          delete curr
          dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> nullptr
                                      ↑    ↑
                                     prev curr (nullptr)

Result:   Return dummy.next = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

### Visual Representation

```
Before:  [1] -> [2] -> [6] -> [3] -> [4] -> [5] -> [6] -> nullptr
         ↑
        head

After:   [1] -> [2] -> [3] -> [4] -> [5] -> nullptr
         ↑
        head
```

## Key Insights

1. **Dummy Node**: Using a dummy node simplifies edge cases, especially when the head needs to be removed
2. **Two Pointers**: `prev` tracks the previous valid node, `curr` traverses the list
3. **Memory Management**: Properly delete removed nodes to prevent memory leaks
4. **Pointer Updates**: Only update `prev` when we don't remove a node; otherwise, `prev` stays the same

## Algorithm Breakdown

```python
def removeElements(self, head, val):
    # Handle empty list
    if(head == None) return head
    # Create dummy node to simplify edge cases
    def dummy(self, 0, head)
    ListNode prev = dummy  # Previous valid node
    ListNode curr = head    # Current node being checked
    ListNode toDelete = None
    while curr != None:
        if curr.val == val:
            # Skip the current node
            prev.next = curr.next
            toDelete = curr  # Mark for deletion
             else :
            # Move prev forward only when we keep the node
            prev = curr
        # Move to next node
        curr = curr.next
        # Delete removed node
        if toDelete != None:
            delete toDelete
            toDelete = None
    return dummy.next  # Return new head

```

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty list**: `head = []` → return `[]`
2. **Head needs removal**: `head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7` → return `[]`
3. **All nodes removed**: `head = [1,1,1], val = 1` → return `[]`
4. **No nodes removed**: `head = [1,2,3], val = 4` → return `[1,2,3]`
5. **Remove from middle**: `head = [1,2,3,2,4], val = 2` → return `[1,3,4]`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not using dummy node**: Makes it harder to handle head removal
2. **Incorrect pointer updates**: Forgetting to update `prev` only when keeping a node
3. **Memory leaks**: Not deleting removed nodes
4. **Returning wrong pointer**: Should return `dummy.next`, not `head`
5. **Null pointer dereference**: Not checking if `head` is `nullptr` first

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 2: Recursive Solution

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - Due to recursion stack

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head, val):
        if head == None:
            return head

        head.next = self.removeElements(head.next, val)

        return head.next if head.val == val else head
```

### Approach 3: Simplified Iterative (No Memory Deletion)

For LeetCode submissions where memory management isn't required:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head, val):
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)

        prev = dummy
        curr = head

        while curr != None:
            if curr.val == val:
                prev.next = curr.next
            else:
                prev = curr

            curr = curr.next

        return dummy.next
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Iterative with Dummy** | O(n) | O(1) | Space efficient, handles all cases | Requires memory management |
| **Recursive** | O(n) | O(n) | Elegant, concise | Stack overflow risk for long lists |
| **Simplified Iterative** | O(n) | O(1) | Simple, no memory management | Doesn't free memory (fine for LeetCode) |

## Optimization Notes

1. **Dummy Node Pattern**: Essential for simplifying linked list deletion problems
2. **Memory Management**: In production code, always delete removed nodes
3. **Early Termination**: Could optimize by checking if list is empty first
4. **Pointer Safety**: Always check for `nullptr` before dereferencing
