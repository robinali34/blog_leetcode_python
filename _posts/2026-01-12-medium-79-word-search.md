# [Medium] 79. Word Search

## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` *if* `word` *exists in the grid*.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- `m == board.length`
- `n = board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 6`
- `1 <= word.length <= 15`
- `board` and `word` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Cell reuse**: Can we reuse the same cell multiple times in a path? (Assumption: No - each cell can be used at most once in a path)

2. **Movement directions**: In which directions can we move? (Assumption: Up, down, left, right - 4 directions, no diagonals)

3. **Case sensitivity**: Are character comparisons case-sensitive? (Assumption: Yes - 'A' and 'a' are different)

4. **Word matching**: Do we need exact match or can it be a subsequence? (Assumption: Exact match - contiguous path forming the exact word)

5. **Starting position**: Can we start from any cell? (Assumption: Yes - can start from any cell that matches the first character of word)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Try all possible paths starting from each cell that matches the first character. Use recursive backtracking to explore all 4 directions from each cell. Mark visited cells to avoid cycles, then unmark when backtracking. This approach works but can be inefficient if not optimized, potentially exploring many invalid paths. The time complexity is O(m × n × 4^L) where L is the word length, which can be slow for large boards.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Add early termination: if the current path cannot possibly form the word (remaining characters don't match), backtrack immediately. Also, use a visited set or boolean array to track visited cells more efficiently. Prune paths that are clearly invalid. However, the worst-case complexity remains exponential, though average case improves significantly with pruning.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use DFS with backtracking and careful visited tracking. Mark the current cell as visited before recursion, then unmark after backtracking (to allow reuse in different paths). Add early termination when the current character doesn't match. Use in-place modification of the board (marking with a special character) to avoid extra space, or use a separate visited array. The key optimization is proper backtracking: mark visited before exploring, unmark after exploring, ensuring all paths are considered while avoiding cycles. This achieves the best possible time complexity for this problem, with O(m × n × 4^L) worst case but much better average case with pruning.

## Solution Approach

This is a classic **backtracking with DFS** problem on a 2D grid. The key insight is to explore all possible paths from each starting position, marking cells as visited during exploration and restoring them when backtracking.

### Key Insights:

1. **DFS Exploration**: Start from each cell and explore all 4 directions
2. **Visited Marking**: Mark current cell as visited (e.g., `'#'`) to avoid revisiting
3. **Backtracking**: Restore cell value after exploring all paths from it
4. **Early Termination**: Return `true` as soon as word is found
5. **Boundary Checking**: Check bounds and character match before recursing

### Algorithm:

1. **For each cell**: Try starting the word search from that cell
2. **DFS Function**:
   - Base case: If `idx == word.length()`, return `true`
   - Check bounds and character match
   - Mark cell as visited
   - Explore all 4 directions
   - Restore cell value (backtrack)
3. **Return**: `true` if word found, `false` otherwise

## Solution

### **Solution: Backtracking with DFS**

```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board, word):
        rows = len(board)
        cols = len(board[0])

        dirs = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if self.backtrack(board, word, r, c, 0, rows, cols, dirs):
                    return True

        return False

    def backtrack(self, board, word, row, col, idx, rows, cols, dirs):
        if idx == len(word):
            return True

        if (row < 0 or row >= rows or
            col < 0 or col >= cols or
            board[row][col] != word[idx]):
            return False

        temp = board[row][col]
        board[row][col] = '#'

        for dr, dc in dirs:
            if self.backtrack(board, word, row + dr, col + dc, idx + 1, rows, cols, dirs):
                return True

        board[row][col] = temp
        return False
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Main Function (Lines 3-12)**:
   - Store `rows` and `cols` dimensions
   - **For each cell `(r, c)`**: Try starting word search from that cell
   - If any starting position finds the word, return `true`
   - Otherwise, return `false`

2. **Backtrack Function (Lines 17-28)**:
   - **Base Case (Line 18)**: If `idx == word.length()`, we've matched entire word → return `true`
   - **Validation (Lines 19-21)**:
     - Check bounds: `row` and `col` within grid
     - Check character match: `board[row][col] == word[idx]`
     - If invalid, return `false`
   - **Mark as Visited (Line 23)**: Set `board[row][col] = '#'` to prevent revisiting
   - **Explore Directions (Lines 24-26)**:
     - Try all 4 directions: right, left, down, up
     - If any direction finds the word, return `true` immediately
   - **Backtrack (Line 27)**: Restore original character `board[row][col] = word[idx]`
   - **Return (Line 28)**: Return `false` if no path found

### **Why This Works:**

- **DFS Exploration**: Explores all possible paths from each starting position
- **Visited Marking**: Using `'#'` prevents revisiting the same cell in current path
- **Backtracking**: Restoring cell value allows exploring other paths that might use this cell
- **Early Termination**: Returns `true` as soon as word is found (no need to explore further)
- **Direction Array**: Clean way to iterate through 4 directions

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `board = [["A","B","C"],["S","F","C"]], word = "ABCCED"`:**

```
Starting from (0,0) with word "ABCCED":

backtrack(0, 0, 0):
  idx=0, board[0][0]='A' == word[0]='A' ✓
  Mark: board[0][0]='#'
  
  Try direction (0,1): backtrack(0, 1, 1)
    idx=1, board[0][1]='B' == word[1]='B' ✓
    Mark: board[0][1]='#'
    
    Try direction (0,2): backtrack(0, 2, 2)
      idx=2, board[0][2]='C' == word[2]='C' ✓
      Mark: board[0][2]='#'

    Try direction (0,0): board[0][0]='#' ✗ (visited)
    Try direction (1,2): backtrack(1, 2, 2)
      idx=2, board[1][2]='C' == word[2]='C' ✓
      Mark: board[1][2]='#'
      
      Try direction (1,3): Out of bounds ✗
      Try direction (1,1): backtrack(1, 1, 3)
        idx=3, board[1][1]='F' != word[3]='C' ✗
      Try direction (2,2): Out of bounds ✗
      Try direction (0,2): backtrack(0, 2, 3)
        idx=3, board[0][2]='C' == word[3]='C' ✓
        Mark: board[0][2]='#'
        
        Try direction (0,3): Out of bounds ✗
        Try direction (0,1): board[0][1]='#' ✗ (visited)
        Try direction (1,2): board[1][2]='#' ✗ (visited)
        Try direction (-1,2): Out of bounds ✗
        Backtrack: board[0][2]='C'
      Backtrack: board[1][2]='C'
    Backtrack: board[0][1]='B'
  Backtrack: board[0][0]='A'

No path found from (0,0). Try other starting positions...
```

**Note**: The actual path for "ABCCED" might not exist in this small example. The algorithm correctly explores all possibilities.

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(m × n × 4^L) where L is word length
  - For each of `m × n` starting positions
  - Explore up to `4^L` paths (4 directions, L depth)
  - With pruning (character mismatch), actual complexity is better
- **Space Complexity:** O(L)
  - Recursion stack depth: at most `L` (word length)
  - No additional data structures (modifies board in-place)

## Key Insights

1. **DFS with Backtracking**: Explore all paths, restore state after exploring
2. **In-Place Marking**: Use `'#'` to mark visited cells (no extra visited array needed)
3. **Early Termination**: Return `true` immediately when word is found
4. **Direction Array**: Clean iteration through 4 directions
5. **Boundary Checking**: Check bounds and character match before recursing

## Edge Cases

1. **Single character word**: `word = "A"` → return `true` if 'A' exists in board
2. **Word longer than board**: Impossible, but handled by bounds checking
3. **All cells same character**: `board = [["A","A"],["A","A"]]`, `word = "AAA"` → return `true`
4. **No matching path**: Return `false` after exploring all possibilities
5. **Word not found**: Return `false`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not restoring cell value**: Forgetting to backtrack causes incorrect results
2. **Wrong visited marking**: Not marking before recursion or marking incorrectly
3. **Missing bounds check**: Accessing out-of-bounds indices
4. **Wrong character comparison**: Comparing before marking as visited
5. **Not checking all starting positions**: Only checking first cell

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 2: Using Visited Array**

```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board, word):
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])

        visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if self.dfs(board, word, i, j, 0, visited, m, n):
                    return True

        return False

    def dfs(self, board, word, i, j, idx, visited, m, n):
        if idx == len(word):
            return True

        if (i < 0 or i >= m or
            j < 0 or j >= n or
            visited[i][j] or
            board[i][j] != word[idx]):
            return False

        visited[i][j] = True

        dirs = [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]

        for dr, dc in dirs:
            if self.dfs(board, word, i + dr, j + dc, idx + 1, visited, m, n):
                return True

        visited[i][j] = False
        return False
```

**Time Complexity:** O(m × n × 4^L)  
**Space Complexity:** O(m × n + L) (visited array + recursion stack)

**Comparison:**
- **In-place marking**: More space-efficient, modifies board
- **Visited array**: Preserves board, uses extra O(m × n) space
