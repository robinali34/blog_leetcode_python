# [Medium] 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

- For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return *the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers*. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Number formation**: How are numbers formed? (Assumption: Concatenate node values along root-to-leaf path - e.g., 1->2->3 forms 123)

2. **Sum calculation**: What should we sum? (Assumption: Sum all root-to-leaf numbers - sum of all path numbers)

3. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - sum of all root-to-leaf numbers)

4. **Single node**: What if tree has one node? (Assumption: Return that node's value - single path)

5. **Node values**: What is the range of node values? (Assumption: Per constraints, 0 <= Node.val <= 9 - single digits)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Find all root-to-leaf paths, convert each path to a number, and sum all numbers. Use DFS to collect all paths, storing each path as a list of values. Then for each path, convert to number and sum. This requires O(n × h) space to store all paths where h is height, and O(n × h) time to process them.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use DFS with backtracking: maintain current path sum as we traverse. When reaching a leaf, add the current number to total sum. Backtrack by removing the last digit. This avoids storing all paths but still requires careful backtracking logic to maintain the correct number representation.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use recursive DFS passing the current number down the tree. For each node, update current number = current × 10 + node.val. When reaching a leaf, return the current number. For internal nodes, return sum of left subtree + sum of right subtree. This achieves O(n) time to visit all nodes and O(h) space for recursion stack, which is optimal. The key insight is that we don't need to store paths - we can build the number incrementally as we traverse and accumulate sums at leaf nodes.

## Solution: DFS with Path Accumulation

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of nodes  
**Space Complexity:** O(h) where h is the height of the tree (recursion stack)

The key insight is to traverse the tree using DFS, maintaining the current number formed by the path from root to the current node. When we reach a leaf node, we add that number to the total sum.

### Solution 1: Recursive DFS (Preorder)

```python
/
 Definition for a binary tree node.
 struct TreeNode :
     val
     TreeNode left
     TreeNode right
     TreeNode() : val(0), left(None), right(None) :
     TreeNode(x) : val(x), left(None), right(None) :
     TreeNode(x, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) :
/
class Solution:
def preorder(self, node, currNum, rootToLeaf):
    if (node == None) return
    currNum = currNum  10 + node.val
    if node.left == None  and  node.right == None:
        rootToLeaf += currNum
    preorder(node.left, currNum, rootToLeaf)
    preorder(node.right, currNum, rootToLeaf)
def sumNumbers(self, root):
    rootToLeaf = 0
    preorder(root, 0, rootToLeaf)
    return rootToLeaf

```

**Key Points:**
- Uses preorder traversal (process node, then left, then right)
- Passes `currNum` by value (each recursive call gets its own copy)
- Accumulates sum in `rootToLeaf` by reference
- Only adds to sum when reaching a leaf node

### Solution 2: Morris Traversal (O(1) Space)

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

Morris traversal allows us to traverse the tree without using a stack or recursion, achieving O(1) space complexity.

```python
/
 Definition for a binary tree node.
 struct TreeNode :
     val
     TreeNode left
     TreeNode right
     TreeNode() : val(0), left(None), right(None) :
     TreeNode(x) : val(x), left(None), right(None) :
     TreeNode(x, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) :
/
class Solution:
def sumNumbers(self, root):
    rootToLeaf = 0, currNum = 0
    steps
    TreeNode predecessor
    while root != None:
        if root.left != None:
            # Find the inorder predecessor
            predecessor = root.left
            steps = 1
            while predecessor.right != None  and  predecessor.right != root:
                predecessor = predecessor.right
                steps += 1
            if predecessor.right == None:
                # Make current node the right child of its predecessor
                currNum = currNum  10 + root.val
                predecessor.right = root
                root = root.left
                 else :
                # Revert the changes made in the 'if' part to restore the original tree
                if predecessor.left == None:
                    rootToLeaf += currNum
                for (i = 0 i < steps i += 1) :
                currNum /= 10
            predecessor.right = None
            root = root.right
         else :
        currNum = currNum  10 + root.val
        if root.right == None:
            rootToLeaf += currNum
        root = root.right
return rootToLeaf

```

**How Morris Traversal Works:**
1. **Thread Creation**: When visiting a node with a left child, find its inorder predecessor
2. **Link Creation**: Make the current node the right child of its predecessor (creating a temporary link)
3. **Traversal**: Move to the left child
4. **Link Removal**: When returning to a node via the temporary link, remove it and move right
5. **Number Tracking**: Track the current number and steps taken to backtrack correctly

**Key Points:**
- **O(1) space**: No recursion stack or explicit stack needed
- **Temporary links**: Uses right pointers of leaf nodes to create temporary links
- **Backtracking**: Divides `currNum` by 10 to backtrack when removing links
- **Complex logic**: More complex but achieves optimal space complexity

## How the Algorithm Works

### Key Insight: Path Accumulation

**Path Number Construction:**
- Start with `prevSum = 0` at the root
- For each node, multiply `prevSum` by 10 and add the current node's value
- This builds the number digit by digit as we traverse down the tree

**Leaf Detection:**
- When both `left` and `right` are `nullptr`, we've reached a leaf
- Return the accumulated sum for this path
- Otherwise, recursively sum results from left and right subtrees

### Step-by-Step Example: `root = [1,2,3]`

```
Tree Structure:
    1
   / \
  2   3

Traversal:
1. dfs(1, 0)
   - sum = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1
   - Not a leaf (has children)
   - Return dfs(2, 1) + dfs(3, 1)

2. dfs(2, 1)
   - sum = 1 * 10 + 2 = 12
   - Is a leaf (no children)
   - Return 12

3. dfs(3, 1)
   - sum = 1 * 10 + 3 = 13
   - Is a leaf (no children)
   - Return 13

Final: 12 + 13 = 25
```

**Visual Representation:**
```
        1 (prevSum=0, sum=1)
       / \
      2   3
    (sum=12) (sum=13)
    
Paths:
1->2: 12
1->3: 13
Total: 25
```

### Step-by-Step Example: `root = [4,9,0,5,1]`

```
Tree Structure:
        4
       / \
      9   0
     / \
    5   1

Traversal:
1. dfs(4, 0)
   - sum = 0 * 10 + 4 = 4
   - Not a leaf
   - Return dfs(9, 4) + dfs(0, 4)

2. dfs(9, 4)
   - sum = 4 * 10 + 9 = 49
   - Not a leaf
   - Return dfs(5, 49) + dfs(1, 49)

3. dfs(5, 49)
   - sum = 49 * 10 + 5 = 495
   - Is a leaf
   - Return 495

4. dfs(1, 49)
   - sum = 49 * 10 + 1 = 491
   - Is a leaf
   - Return 491

5. dfs(0, 4)
   - sum = 4 * 10 + 0 = 40
   - Is a leaf
   - Return 40

Final: 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026
```

## Key Insights

1. **Path Accumulation**: Build the number incrementally by multiplying by 10 and adding the current digit
2. **Leaf Detection**: Only add to sum when reaching a leaf node (no children)
3. **Recursive Sum**: Combine results from left and right subtrees
4. **Base Case**: Return 0 for null nodes (handles empty subtrees)

## Algorithm Breakdown

### Solution 1: Recursive Preorder

#### Helper Function: `preorder(node, currNum, rootToLeaf)`

```python
def preorder(self, node, currNum, rootToLeaf):
    if (node == None) return

```

**Why:** Handle null nodes gracefully. Return early if node is null.

```python
currNum = currNum  10 + node.val

```

**Why:** Build the current path number by:
- Multiplying previous sum by 10 (shift digits left)
- Adding current node's value (append new digit)

```python
if node.left == None  and  node.right == None:
    rootToLeaf += currNum




```

**Why:** Leaf node reached. Add the complete path number to the total sum.

```python
preorder(node.left, currNum, rootToLeaf)
preorder(node.right, currNum, rootToLeaf)




```

**Why:** Continue traversal to both subtrees. `currNum` is passed by value, so each recursive call gets its own copy.

#### Main Function: `sumNumbers(root)`

```python
def sumNumbers(self, root):
    rootToLeaf = 0
    preorder(root, 0, rootToLeaf)
    return rootToLeaf




```

**Why:** Initialize sum to 0, start preorder traversal from root, return accumulated sum.

**Key Difference from Previous Approach:**
- Uses `void` function that accumulates result in a reference parameter
- Passes `currNum` by value (each call gets independent copy)
- More explicit about accumulating the sum

### Solution 2: Morris Traversal

#### Key Components

**1. Finding Predecessor:**
```python
predecessor = root.left
steps = 1
while predecessor.right != None  and  predecessor.right != root:
    predecessor = predecessor.right
    steps += 1




```
- Find the rightmost node in the left subtree
- Track number of steps for backtracking

**2. Creating Temporary Link:**
```python
if predecessor.right == None:
    currNum = currNum  10 + root.val
    predecessor.right = root  # Create link
    root = root.left

```
- Create temporary link from predecessor to current node
- This allows us to return to current node later

**3. Removing Link and Backtracking:**
```python
else:
    if predecessor.left == None:
        rootToLeaf += currNum
    for (i = 0 i < steps i += 1) :
    currNum /= 10  # Backtrack number
predecessor.right = None  # Remove link
root = root.right

```
- When we return via temporary link, we've finished left subtree
- Backtrack `currNum` by dividing by 10 for each step
- Remove temporary link to restore tree structure

## Edge Cases

1. **Single node**: Tree with one node returns that node's value
2. **All left children**: Skewed tree to the left
3. **All right children**: Skewed tree to the right
4. **Node with value 0**: Zero values are handled correctly
5. **Deep tree**: Up to depth 10 (constraint)

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 2: Iterative DFS with Stack

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(h)

```python
class Solution:
def sumNumbers(self, root):
    if(root == None) return 0
    list[pair<TreeNode, int>> stk
    stk.push(:root, 0)
    totalSum = 0
    while not not stk:
        [node, prevSum] = stk.top()
        stk.pop()
        sum = prevSum  10 + node.val
        if node.left == None  and  node.right == None:
            totalSum += sum
             else :
            if node.right != None:
                stk.push(:node.right, sum)
            if node.left != None:
                stk.push(:node.left, sum)
    return totalSum

```

**Pros:**
- Avoids recursion stack overflow
- More control over traversal order

**Cons:**
- More verbose
- Still O(h) space for stack

### Approach 3: BFS with Queue

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(w) where w is the maximum width

```python
class Solution:
def sumNumbers(self, root):
    if(root == None) return 0
    deque[pair<TreeNode, int>> q
    q.push(:root, 0)
    totalSum = 0
    while not not q:
        [node, prevSum] = q[0]
        q.pop()
        sum = prevSum  10 + node.val
        if node.left == None  and  node.right == None:
            totalSum += sum
             else :
            if node.left != None:
                q.push(:node.left, sum)
            if node.right != None:
                q.push(:node.right, sum)
    return totalSum

```

**Pros:**
- Level-order traversal
- Can be useful for certain tree structures

**Cons:**
- Uses more space for wide trees
- Less intuitive for this problem

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **Recursive DFS (Preorder)** | O(n) | O(h) | Simple, elegant | Recursion overhead |
| **Morris Traversal** | O(n) | O(1) | Optimal space | Complex implementation |
| **Iterative DFS** | O(n) | O(h) | No recursion | More code |
| **BFS** | O(n) | O(w) | Level-order | More space for wide trees |

## Implementation Details

### Why Multiply by 10?

**Decimal Number System:**
```
Path: 1 -> 2 -> 3
Step 1: 0 * 10 + 1 = 1
Step 2: 1 * 10 + 2 = 12
Step 3: 12 * 10 + 3 = 123
```

Multiplying by 10 shifts digits left, making room for the new digit.

### Recursive Call Structure

```python
return dfs(node.left, sum) + dfs(node.right, sum)




```

**Breakdown:**
1. `dfs(node->left, sum)`: Sum of all paths through left subtree
2. `dfs(node->right, sum)`: Sum of all paths through right subtree
3. Add both results together

### Path Accumulation Pattern

```
Root: prevSum = 0
  ↓
Node 1: prevSum * 10 + val1 = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1
  ↓
Node 2: prevSum * 10 + val2 = 1 * 10 + 2 = 12
  ↓
Leaf: return 12
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting to multiply by 10**: Results in incorrect number construction
2. **Not checking for leaf nodes**: May double-count or miss paths
3. **Not handling null nodes**: Can cause null pointer exceptions
4. **Wrong base case**: Returning wrong value for null nodes
5. **Not passing accumulated sum**: Forgetting to pass `sum` to recursive calls

## Optimization Tips

1. **Early termination**: Not applicable here (must visit all leaves)
2. **Memoization**: Not useful (each path is unique)
3. **Iterative for deep trees**: Use iterative approach to avoid stack overflow

- No recursion or explicit stack
- Useful for memory-constrained environments

**Morris Traversal Disadvantages:**
- More complex implementation
- Modifies tree structure temporarily (though restored)
- Harder to understand and debug

**BFS Alternative:**
- Can work but less intuitive
- Requires storing path information for each node
- More space for wide trees

## Morris Traversal Deep Dive

### How It Works

Morris traversal is a technique to traverse a binary tree without using a stack or recursion. It uses temporary links (threads) to navigate the tree.

**Key Steps:**

1. **If current node has left child:**
   - Find the inorder predecessor (rightmost node in left subtree)
   - If predecessor's right is null, create a temporary link to current node
   - Move to left child
   - If predecessor's right points to current, we've already visited left subtree
   - Remove the link and move to right child

2. **If current node has no left child:**
   - Process current node
   - Move to right child

### Step-by-Step Morris Traversal: `root = [1,2,3]`

```
Initial: root = 1, currNum = 0, rootToLeaf = 0

Step 1: root = 1 (has left child = 2)
  - Find predecessor: 2 (no right child)
  - currNum = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1
  - Create link: 2->right = 1
  - Move to left: root = 2

Step 2: root = 2 (no left child)
  - currNum = 1 * 10 + 2 = 12
  - Is leaf? Yes → rootToLeaf += 12 (rootToLeaf = 12)
  - Move to right: root = 1 (via temporary link)

Step 3: root = 1 (has left child = 2, and 2->right = 1)
  - Predecessor found with link back to 1
  - Backtrack: currNum = 12 / 10 = 1
  - Remove link: 2->right = nullptr
  - Move to right: root = 3

Step 4: root = 3 (no left child)
  - currNum = 1 * 10 + 3 = 13
  - Is leaf? Yes → rootToLeaf += 13 (rootToLeaf = 25)
  - Move to right: root = nullptr

Done: return 25
```

### Why Divide by 10?

When backtracking in Morris traversal, we need to undo the number accumulation. Since we multiplied by 10 for each step down, we divide by 10 for each step back up.

```
Going down: 0 → 1 → 12
Going up:   12 → 1 (divide by 10)
Going down: 1 → 13
```

### When to Use Morris Traversal

**Use Morris Traversal when:**
- Memory is extremely constrained
- Need O(1) space complexity
- Tree structure can be temporarily modified

**Use Recursive DFS when:**
- Code simplicity is priority
- Space is not a concern
- Need easy-to-understand solution

## Step-by-Step Trace: `root = [4,9,0,5,1]`

```
Tree:
        4
       / \
      9   0
     / \
    5   1

Call Stack:
dfs(4, 0)
├─ sum = 4
├─ dfs(9, 4)
│  ├─ sum = 49
│  ├─ dfs(5, 49) → 495 (leaf)
│  └─ dfs(1, 49) → 491 (leaf)
│  Returns: 495 + 491 = 986
└─ dfs(0, 4)
   └─ sum = 40 → 40 (leaf)
   Returns: 40

Final: 986 + 40 = 1026
```

## Mathematical Insight

**Number Construction:**
For a path with digits `d₁, d₂, ..., dₖ`:
```
Number = d₁ × 10^(k-1) + d₂ × 10^(k-2) + ... + dₖ × 10^0
```

**Our Approach:**
```
Step 1: num = d₁
Step 2: num = num × 10 + d₂ = d₁ × 10 + d₂
Step 3: num = num × 10 + d₃ = (d₁ × 10 + d₂) × 10 + d₃ = d₁ × 100 + d₂ × 10 + d₃
...
```

This matches the mathematical formula!
