# 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck

## Problem Statement

You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto **one truck**. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]`:

- `numberOfBoxesi` is the number of boxes of type `i`.
- `numberOfUnitsPerBoxi` is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the **maximum number of boxes** that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.

Return *the **maximum** total number of **units** that can be put on the truck*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4
Output: 8
Explanation: There are:
- 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
- 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
- 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10
Output: 91
Explanation: 
- Take 5 boxes of type 1 (5 * 10 = 50 units)
- Take 3 boxes of type 3 (3 * 9 = 27 units)
- Take 2 boxes of type 2 (2 * 5 = 10 units)
- Take 0 boxes of type 4
Total: 50 + 27 + 10 = 87... wait, let me recalculate.
Actually: Take boxes in order of units per box (descending):
- 5 boxes of type 1: 5 * 10 = 50
- 3 boxes of type 3: 3 * 9 = 27
- 2 boxes of type 2: 2 * 5 = 10
Total: 50 + 27 + 10 = 87, but we have 10 boxes, so we can take 2 more boxes of type 4: 2 * 7 = 14
Total: 50 + 27 + 10 + 14 = 101... Actually, let me verify with the algorithm.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= boxTypes.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi <= 1000`
- `1 <= truckSize <= 10^6`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Box format**: How are boxes represented? (Assumption: [numberOfBoxes, numberOfUnitsPerBox] - number of boxes and units per box)

2. **Truck capacity**: What is truck capacity? (Assumption: truckSize - maximum number of boxes that can fit on truck)

3. **Optimization goal**: What are we optimizing for? (Assumption: Maximum total units that can be loaded on truck)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - maximum units that can be loaded)

5. **Box selection**: Can we take partial boxes? (Assumption: No - must take whole boxes, cannot break boxes)

## Interview Deduction Process (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (2 minutes)**

Try all possible combinations of boxes that fit within truck capacity. For each combination, calculate total units and track the maximum. This approach has exponential complexity as we try all subsets of boxes, which is infeasible for large inputs.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (3 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming: dp[i][capacity] = maximum units using first i box types with given capacity. This requires O(n × capacity) time and space, which works but can be optimized further since we can take multiple boxes of the same type.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (5 minutes)**

Use greedy approach: sort boxes by units per box in descending order. Greedily take boxes with highest units per box first until truck capacity is reached. This works because if we have capacity for one more box, we should always choose the box with highest units per box. This achieves O(n log n) time for sorting plus O(n) for selection, which is optimal. The key insight is that this is a fractional knapsack-like problem where we want to maximize value (units) given weight constraint (box count), and greedy works perfectly when we can't break items but want to maximize value-to-weight ratio.

## Solution Approach

This is a classic **greedy algorithm** problem. The key insight is to prioritize boxes with the highest units per box, as this maximizes the total units we can fit in the limited truck space.

### Key Insights:

1. **Sort by Units Per Box**: Sort boxes in descending order of `numberOfUnitsPerBoxi`
2. **Greedy Selection**: Always take as many boxes as possible from the highest-unit boxes first
3. **Optimal**: This greedy strategy maximizes total units
4. **Fill Remaining Space**: Take boxes until truck is full

### Algorithm:

1. **Sort**: Sort `boxTypes` by `numberOfUnitsPerBoxi` in descending order
2. **Greedy Fill**: For each box type, take as many boxes as possible
3. **Track Remaining**: Keep track of remaining truck capacity
4. **Calculate Units**: Sum up units from selected boxes

## Solution

### **Solution: Greedy with Sorting**

```python
class Solution:
def maximumUnits(self, boxTypes, truckSize):
    sort(boxTypes.begin(), boxTypes.end(), [](u, v):
    return u[1] > v[1]
    )
    remainSize = truckSize
    maximumUnits = 0
    for boxType in boxTypes:
        if(remainSize == 0) break
        cnt = min(remainSize, boxType[0])
        maximumUnits += cnt  boxType[1]
        remainSize -= cnt
    return maximumUnits
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Sort by Units Per Box (Lines 4-6)**:
   - Sort `boxTypes` in descending order of `boxType[1]` (units per box)
   - This ensures we process boxes with highest units first
   - Custom comparator: `u[1] > v[1]` sorts by units per box (descending)

2. **Initialize Variables (Lines 7-8)**:
   - `remainSize`: Remaining truck capacity (starts at `truckSize`)
   - `maximumUnits`: Total units accumulated (starts at 0)

3. **Greedy Selection (Lines 9-14)**:
   - **For each box type** (in sorted order):
     - **Early termination**: If `remainSize == 0`, break (truck is full)
     - **Take boxes**: `cnt = min(remainSize, boxType[0])`
       - Take as many boxes as possible, limited by:
         - Remaining truck capacity (`remainSize`)
         - Available boxes of this type (`boxType[0]`)
     - **Add units**: `maximumUnits += cnt * boxType[1]`
     - **Update capacity**: `remainSize -= cnt`

4. **Return (Line 15)**:
   - Return the total units accumulated

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**Example 1: `boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4`**

**After sorting by units per box (descending):**
```
Original: [[1,3], [2,2], [3,1]]
Sorted:   [[1,3], [2,2], [3,1]]  (already in order: 3 > 2 > 1)
```

**Execution:**
```
Initial: remainSize = 4, maximumUnits = 0

Step 1: boxType = [1, 3]
  cnt = min(4, 1) = 1
  maximumUnits = 0 + 1 * 3 = 3
  remainSize = 4 - 1 = 3

Step 2: boxType = [2, 2]
  cnt = min(3, 2) = 2
  maximumUnits = 3 + 2 * 2 = 7
  remainSize = 3 - 2 = 1

Step 3: boxType = [3, 1]
  cnt = min(1, 3) = 1
  maximumUnits = 7 + 1 * 1 = 8
  remainSize = 1 - 1 = 0

Result: 8
```

**Visual Representation:**
```
Box Types (sorted by units):
Type 1: [1 box, 3 units/box] → Take 1 box → 3 units
Type 2: [2 boxes, 2 units/box] → Take 2 boxes → 4 units
Type 3: [3 boxes, 1 unit/box] → Take 1 box → 1 unit
Total: 3 + 4 + 1 = 8 units
```

**Example 2: `boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10`**

**After sorting by units per box (descending):**
```
Original: [[5,10], [2,5], [4,7], [3,9]]
Sorted:   [[5,10], [3,9], [4,7], [2,5]]  (10 > 9 > 7 > 5)
```

**Execution:**
```
Initial: remainSize = 10, maximumUnits = 0

Step 1: boxType = [5, 10]
  cnt = min(10, 5) = 5
  maximumUnits = 0 + 5 * 10 = 50
  remainSize = 10 - 5 = 5

Step 2: boxType = [3, 9]
  cnt = min(5, 3) = 3
  maximumUnits = 50 + 3 * 9 = 77
  remainSize = 5 - 3 = 2

Step 3: boxType = [4, 7]
  cnt = min(2, 4) = 2
  maximumUnits = 77 + 2 * 7 = 91
  remainSize = 2 - 2 = 0

Step 4: boxType = [2, 5]
  remainSize == 0, break

Result: 91
```

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Why Greedy Works**

The greedy strategy is optimal because:
1. **Highest Units First**: Taking boxes with highest units per box maximizes units per box slot
2. **No Regret**: If we skip a high-unit box, we can't use that capacity later
3. **Optimal Substructure**: After taking boxes, the remaining problem is independent
4. **Mathematical Proof**: Any other ordering would result in fewer total units

**Intuition:**
- If we have 1 box slot and two options:
  - Box A: 10 units
  - Box B: 5 units
- We should take Box A (greedy choice)
- This applies recursively: always take the best available option

### **Why Sorting is Necessary**

Without sorting, we might:
- Take low-unit boxes first, wasting capacity
- Miss opportunities to maximize units
- Need to check all combinations (exponential)

With sorting:
- Process boxes in order of value (units per box)
- Greedy choice is optimal
- Linear time after sorting

### **Key Insight: Units Per Box**

The critical metric is **units per box**, not total units:
- Box type [100, 1]: 100 boxes, 1 unit each = 100 total units, but 1 unit/box
- Box type [1, 100]: 1 box, 100 units = 100 total units, but 100 units/box
- If truckSize = 1, we should take the second type (100 units vs 1 unit)

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - **Sorting**: O(n log n) where n = `boxTypes.length`
  - **Greedy Selection**: O(n) - single pass through sorted array
  - **Total**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using a few variables (`remainSize`, `maximumUnits`, `cnt`)
  - Sorting is typically in-place (O(1) extra space)

## Key Points

1. **Greedy Algorithm**: Always make locally optimal choice (highest units per box)
2. **Sorting**: Essential for greedy approach to work correctly
3. **Units Per Box**: The key metric, not total units
4. **Optimal**: Greedy strategy finds maximum units
5. **Simple**: Straightforward implementation after sorting

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: Greedy with Sorting (Current Solution)**
- **Time**: O(n log n)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Best for**: Optimal solution, most efficient

### **Approach 2: Brute Force (Try All Combinations)**
- **Time**: O(2^n) or worse
- **Space**: O(n)
- **Not practical**: Too slow for large inputs

### **Approach 3: Dynamic Programming (Knapsack)**
- **Time**: O(n × truckSize)
- **Space**: O(truckSize)
- **Overkill**: Greedy is optimal and simpler

## Edge Cases

1. **Truck size equals total boxes**: `truckSize = sum(boxTypes[i][0])` → take all boxes
2. **Truck size is 1**: Take one box with highest units per box
3. **All boxes have same units per box**: Order doesn't matter, take until full
4. **Single box type**: Take `min(truckSize, boxTypes[0][0])` boxes
5. **Truck size larger than all boxes**: Take all boxes, return sum of all units

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not sorting**: Trying to select boxes without sorting by units per box
2. **Wrong metric**: Sorting by total units instead of units per box
3. **Wrong order**: Sorting in ascending instead of descending order
4. **Not tracking remaining**: Forgetting to update `remainSize`
5. **Off-by-one errors**: Incorrect calculation of boxes to take
