# [Medium] 253. Meeting Rooms II

Given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of conference rooms required.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= starti < endi <= 10^6`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Meeting format**: How are meetings represented? (Assumption: [start, end] intervals - start is inclusive, end is exclusive or inclusive?)

2. **Overlap definition**: When do meetings overlap? (Assumption: If one meeting starts before another ends - need to clarify if [1,2] and [2,3] overlap)

3. **Optimization goal**: What are we optimizing for? (Assumption: Minimum number of meeting rooms needed to schedule all meetings)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - minimum number of rooms required)

5. **Empty input**: What if there are no meetings? (Assumption: Return 0 - no rooms needed)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to find minimum rooms. Let me check all possible room assignments."

**Naive Solution**: Try all possible ways to assign meetings to rooms, find minimum number of rooms needed.

**Complexity**: Exponential time, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- Exponential time complexity
- Tries many invalid assignments
- Very inefficient
- Doesn't leverage interval properties

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can sort meetings by start time, then use greedy approach with priority queue."

**Improved Solution**: Sort meetings by start time. Use min-heap to track end times of active meetings. For each meeting, if earliest end <= current start, reuse room; else need new room.

**Complexity**: O(n log n) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- Sorting enables chronological processing
- Min-heap efficiently tracks room availability
- O(n log n) time is much better
- Handles all cases correctly

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Min-heap approach is optimal. Can also use chronological ordering with two pointers."

**Best Solution**: Min-heap approach is optimal. Sort by start time, use min-heap for end times. Alternative: chronological ordering with start/end events, track active meetings.

**Complexity**: O(n log n) time, O(n) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Sorting is key insight
2. Min-heap tracks room availability efficiently
3. O(n log n) time is optimal for sorting approach
4. Chronological ordering is alternative approach

## Solution 1: Priority Queue (Min Heap)

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - Sorting + heap operations  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - For the heap

This approach uses a min-heap to track the end times of meetings currently using rooms. When a new meeting starts, we check if any room has freed up (earliest end time <= new start time).

```python
class Solution:
def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals):
    if (len(intervals) == 0) return 0
    sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](list[int> a, list[int> b):
    return a[0] < b[0]
    )
    heapq[int, list[int>, greater<int>> allocator
    allocator.push(intervals[0][1])
    for(i = 1 i < len(intervals) i += 1) :
    if intervals[i][0] >= allocator.top():
        allocator.pop()
    allocator.push(intervals[i][1])
return len(allocator)
```

### How Solution 1 Works

1. **Sort intervals** by start time to process meetings chronologically
2. **Initialize heap** with the end time of the first meeting
3. **For each subsequent meeting**:
   - If the earliest ending meeting has finished (`intervals[i][0] >= allocator.top()`), reuse that room (pop from heap)
   - Add the current meeting's end time to the heap
4. **Result**: The heap size represents the maximum number of concurrent meetings

### Key Insight

The min-heap always contains the end times of all currently active meetings. When a new meeting starts:
- If the earliest ending meeting has finished, we can reuse that room
- Otherwise, we need a new room
- The heap size tracks the maximum number of rooms needed at any point

## Solution 2: Chronological Ordering (Two Pointers)

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - Sorting  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - For separate start and end arrays

This approach separates start and end times, then uses two pointers to simulate the timeline and count concurrent meetings.

```python
class Solution:
def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals):
    if (len(intervals) == 0) return 0
    list[int> start(len(intervals))
    list[int> end(len(intervals))
    for(i = 0 i < len(intervals) i += 1) :
    start[i] = intervals[i][0]
    end[i] = intervals[i][1]
start.sort()
end.sort()
startPointer = 0, endPointer = 0
usedRooms = 0
while startPointer < len(intervals):
    if start[startPointer] >= end[endPointer]:
        usedRooms -= 1
        endPointer += 1
    usedRooms += 1
    startPointer += 1
return usedRooms
```

### How Solution 2 Works

1. **Separate start and end times** into two arrays
2. **Sort both arrays** independently
3. **Use two pointers** to traverse both arrays:
   - `startPointer`: Points to next meeting starting
   - `endPointer`: Points to next meeting ending
4. **Simulate timeline**:
   - When a meeting starts (`startPointer`), increment `usedRooms`
   - If a meeting ends before the new one starts (`start[startPointer] >= end[endPointer]`), decrement `usedRooms` and move `endPointer`
5. **Track maximum**: The maximum value of `usedRooms` during traversal is the answer

### Key Insight

By processing events in chronological order, we can track how many meetings are active at any moment. When a meeting starts, we need a room. When a meeting ends, we free a room.

## Solution 3: Bucket Sort (Event-Based)

**Time Complexity:** O(n + k) where k is the time range (10^6) → effectively O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(k) where k is the maximum time value

This approach uses bucket sort to create a timeline array. For each interval, we increment at start time and decrement at end time, then compute prefix sum to find maximum concurrent meetings.

```python
class Solution:
def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals):
    if (len(intervals) == 0) return 0
    MAX_TIME = 1000000
    list[int> timeline(MAX_TIME + 1, 0)
    // Mark start and end times
    for interval in intervals:
        timeline[interval[0]]++  // Meeting starts
        timeline[interval[1]]--  // Meeting ends
    // Compute prefix sum to find maximum concurrent meetings
    maxRooms = 0
    currentRooms = 0
    for(i = 0 i <= MAX_TIME i += 1) :
    currentRooms += timeline[i]
    maxRooms = max(maxRooms, currentRooms)
return maxRooms
```

### How Solution 3 Works

1. **Create timeline array**: Array of size `MAX_TIME + 1` (10^6 + 1) initialized to 0
2. **Mark events**: 
   - Increment at start time: `timeline[start]++`
   - Decrement at end time: `timeline[end]--`
3. **Compute prefix sum**: Traverse timeline, accumulating values to count concurrent meetings
4. **Track maximum**: Keep track of maximum concurrent meetings during traversal

### Key Insight

This is similar to the "sweep line" approach:
- Each time unit is a bucket
- Start events increment the count
- End events decrement the count
- Prefix sum gives us concurrent meetings at each time point

### When to Use Bucket Sort

**Advantages:**
- O(n) time complexity (no sorting needed)
- Simple and intuitive
- Good when time range is bounded and relatively small

**Disadvantages:**
- O(k) space where k is the time range (10^6 in this case)
- Less efficient if time range is very large or sparse
- Memory overhead if actual meetings are sparse in the time range

### Optimization: Sparse Timeline

If the time range is large but meetings are sparse, we can use a map instead:

```python
class Solution:
def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals):
    if (len(intervals) == 0) return 0
    map<int, int> timeline
    for interval in intervals:
        timeline[interval[0]]++  // Meeting starts
        timeline[interval[1]]--  // Meeting ends
    maxRooms = 0
    currentRooms = 0
    for([time, change] : timeline) :
    currentRooms += change
    maxRooms = max(maxRooms, currentRooms)
return maxRooms
```

This uses O(n log n) time (map insertion) but O(n) space, making it better for sparse data.

## Comparison of Approaches

| Aspect | Priority Queue | Chronological Ordering | Bucket Sort |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n + k) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(n) | O(n) | O(k) |
| **Intuition** | Track active meetings | Simulate timeline | Event-based counting |
| **Code Complexity** | Moderate | Simpler | Simplest |
| **Best For** | General case | General case | Bounded, dense ranges |

## Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]`

### Solution 1 (Priority Queue):
```
Sorted: [[0,30], [5,10], [15,20]]

Step 1: Meeting [0,30] starts
        Heap: [30]
        Rooms: 1

Step 2: Meeting [5,10] starts
        Check: 5 >= 30? No, need new room
        Heap: [10, 30]
        Rooms: 2

Step 3: Meeting [15,20] starts
        Check: 15 >= 10? Yes, room freed
        Pop 10, Heap: [30]
        Push 20, Heap: [20, 30]
        Rooms: 2

Result: 2 rooms needed
```

### Solution 2 (Chronological Ordering):
```
Start: [0, 5, 15]
End:   [10, 20, 30]

Timeline:
0:  Meeting starts → usedRooms = 1
5:  Meeting starts → usedRooms = 2
10: Meeting ends → usedRooms = 1
15: Meeting starts → usedRooms = 2
20: Meeting ends → usedRooms = 1
30: Meeting ends → usedRooms = 0

Maximum usedRooms = 2
```

### Solution 3 (Bucket Sort):
```
Intervals: [[0,30], [5,10], [15,20]]

Timeline array (showing relevant indices):
Index:  0   5   10  15  20  30
Value: +1  +1  -1  +1  -1  -1

Prefix sum:
Index:  0   5   10  15  20  30
Count:  1   2   1   2   1   0

Maximum count = 2
Result: 2 rooms needed
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Priority Queue | Chronological Ordering | Bucket Sort |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Sorting | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | N/A |
| Processing | O(n log n) | O(n) | O(n + k) |
| **Overall** | **O(n log n)** | **O(n log n)** | **O(n + k)** |

**Note:** For bucket sort, k = 10^6 (maximum time value), so O(n + k) is effectively O(n) when n is large, but has constant factor overhead.

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty intervals**: Return 0
2. **Single meeting**: Return 1
3. **No overlaps**: All meetings can use one room
4. **All overlap**: Need n rooms for n meetings
5. **Adjacent meetings**: `[0,5]` and `[5,10]` can share a room

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not sorting**: Must sort by start time first
2. **Wrong comparison**: Using `>` instead of `>=` for end time check
3. **Heap management**: Forgetting to pop when room is freed
4. **Pointer logic**: Incorrect order of operations in two-pointer approach
5. **Edge case handling**: Not checking for empty input

## Optimization Notes

### Solution 1 Optimization:
- The heap size represents active meetings, which is exactly what we need
- No need to track maximum separately - final heap size is the answer

### Solution 2 Optimization:
- Can track maximum during traversal instead of storing all values
- Two separate arrays allow independent sorting

### Solution 3 Optimization:
- For sparse time ranges, use `map<int, int>` instead of array
- This reduces space from O(k) to O(n) but increases time to O(n log n)
- Best when time range is bounded and meetings are dense
