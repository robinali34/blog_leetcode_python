# LC 1094: Car Pooling

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Category:** Array, Sorting, Simulation  
**Companies:** Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Uber

## Problem Statement

There is a car with `capacity` empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer `capacity` and an array `trips` where `trips[i] = [numPassengers, from, to]` indicates that the `i`-th trip has `numPassengers` passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are `from` and `to` respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return `true` if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or `false` otherwise.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false
Explanation: 
- Trip 1: Pick up 2 passengers at location 1, drop off at location 5
- Trip 2: Pick up 3 passengers at location 3, drop off at location 5
- At location 3, we have 2 + 3 = 5 passengers, which exceeds capacity (4)
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 
- Trip 1: Pick up 2 passengers at location 1, drop off at location 5
- Trip 2: Pick up 3 passengers at location 3, drop off at location 5
- At location 3, we have 2 + 3 = 5 passengers, which equals capacity (5)
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= trips.length <= 1000`
- `trips[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= numPassengers <= 100`
- `0 <= from < to <= 1000`

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Bucket Sort with Timestamps (Recommended)

**Key Insight:** Use a bucket array to track passenger changes at each timestamp. Add passengers at pickup locations and subtract at drop-off locations.

**Algorithm:**
1. Create a timestamp array of size 1001 (since locations are 0-1000)
2. For each trip, add passengers at pickup location and subtract at drop-off location
3. Iterate through timestamps and track cumulative passengers
4. Return false if capacity is exceeded at any point

**Time Complexity:** O(n + 1001) = O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1001) = O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: list[list[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        timestamp = [0] * 1001
        for trip in trips:
            timestamp[trip[1]] += trip[0]  # Pick up passengers
            timestamp[trip[2]] -= trip[0]  # Drop off passengers
        usedCapacity = 0
        for number in timestamp:
            usedCapacity += number
            if usedCapacity > capacity:
                return False
        return True
```

### Approach 2: Sorting with Events

**Algorithm:**
1. Create events for pickup and drop-off
2. Sort events by location
3. Process events in order and track passengers
4. Return false if capacity exceeded

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: list[list[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        events = []  # [(location, passenger_change), ...]
        
        for trip in trips:
            events.append((trip[1], trip[0]))   # Pick up
            events.append((trip[2], -trip[0]))  # Drop off
        
        events.sort()
        
        usedCapacity = 0
        for location, change in events:
            usedCapacity += change
            if usedCapacity > capacity:
                return False
        return True
```

### Approach 3: Simulation with Priority Queue

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort trips by pickup location
2. Use priority queue to track active trips
3. Process trips in order and manage drop-offs
4. Check capacity at each pickup

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: list[list[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        trips.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by pickup location
        
        pq = []  # min heap: (dropoff_location, passengers)
        usedCapacity = 0
        
        for trip in trips:
            passengers, pickup, dropoff = trip[0], trip[1], trip[2]
            
            # Drop off passengers who have reached their destination
            while pq and pq[0][0] <= pickup:
                usedCapacity -= heapq.heappop(pq)[1]
            
            # Pick up new passengers
            usedCapacity += passengers
            if usedCapacity > capacity:
                return False
            
            # Add drop-off event
            heapq.heappush(pq, (dropoff, passengers))
        
        return True
```

## Algorithm Analysis

### Approach Comparison

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| Bucket Sort | O(n) | O(1) | Optimal, simple | Limited to small ranges |
| Sorting Events | O(n log n) | O(n) | General purpose | More complex |
| Priority Queue | O(n log n) | O(n) | Handles complex cases | Overkill for this problem |

### Key Insights

1. **Bucket Sort Advantage**: Most efficient for small, bounded ranges
2. **Event Processing**: Treat pickup and drop-off as separate events
3. **Cumulative Tracking**: Track running total of passengers
4. **Early Termination**: Stop as soon as capacity is exceeded

## Implementation Details

### Bucket Sort Technique
```python
# Add passengers at pickup location
timestamp[trip[1]] += trip[0]
# Remove passengers at drop-off location  
timestamp[trip[2]] -= trip[0]
```

### Event Processing
```python
# Process events in chronological order
for number in timestamp:
    usedCapacity += number
    if usedCapacity > capacity:
        return False
```

## Edge Cases

1. **Single Trip**: `[[1,0,1]]` with capacity 1 → true
2. **No Trips**: `[]` with any capacity → true
3. **Exact Capacity**: Passengers exactly equal capacity → true
4. **Overlapping Trips**: Multiple trips at same location → check total

## Follow-up Questions

- What if locations could be very large (up to 10^9)?
- How would you handle multiple cars?
- What if passengers could be picked up and dropped off at the same location?
- How would you optimize for very large numbers of trips?

## Optimization Techniques

1. **Bucket Sort**: Use array indexing for small ranges
2. **Event-Based Processing**: Treat state changes as events
3. **Early Termination**: Stop processing when constraint violated
4. **Space Optimization**: Use fixed-size arrays when possible

## Code Quality Notes

1. **Readability**: Bucket sort approach is most intuitive
2. **Performance**: O(n) time complexity is optimal
3. **Scalability**: Sorting approach works for any range
4. **Robustness**: All approaches handle edge cases correctly
