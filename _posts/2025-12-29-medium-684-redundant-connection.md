# 684. Redundant Connection

## Problem Statement

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return *an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of `n` nodes*. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs **last** in the input.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The edge [2,3] creates a cycle, so it should be removed.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The edge [1,4] creates a cycle, so it should be removed.
```

## Constraints

- `n == edges.length`
- `3 <= n <= 1000`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length`
- `ai != bi`
- There are no repeated edges.
- The given graph is connected.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Redundant edge definition**: What makes an edge redundant? (Assumption: An edge that creates a cycle in an otherwise tree structure - the edge that forms the cycle)

2. **Graph type**: Is the graph directed or undirected? (Assumption: Undirected - edges have no direction)

3. **Tree property**: What is the base structure? (Assumption: Graph with n nodes and n edges - one extra edge makes it not a tree)

4. **Return format**: What should we return if multiple redundant edges exist? (Assumption: Return the last edge in the input array that creates a cycle)

5. **Edge representation**: How are edges represented? (Assumption: [ai, bi] where ai and bi are node labels, 1-indexed per constraints)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)
**Initial Thought**: "I need to find redundant edge. Let me check each edge to see if removing it breaks connectivity."

**Naive Solution**: For each edge, remove it and check if graph remains connected. If removing edge breaks connectivity, it's not redundant.

**Complexity**: O(n²) time, O(n) space

**Issues**:
- O(n²) time - inefficient
- Repeats connectivity checks
- Doesn't leverage Union-Find
- Can be optimized

### Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)
**Insight**: "I can use Union-Find. The first edge that connects already-connected components is redundant."

**Improved Solution**: Use Union-Find. Process edges in order. If edge connects already-connected components, it's redundant. Return first such edge.

**Complexity**: O(n × α(n)) time, O(n) space

**Improvements**:
- Union-Find efficiently checks connectivity
- O(n × α(n)) is nearly linear
- Handles all cases correctly
- Much more efficient

### Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)
**Final Optimization**: "Union-Find approach is optimal. Can also use DFS for cycle detection."

**Best Solution**: Union-Find is optimal. Process edges, when find(u) == find(v), edge is redundant. Alternative: DFS to find cycle, return last edge in cycle.

**Complexity**: O(n × α(n)) time, O(n) space

**Key Realizations**:
1. Union-Find is perfect for connectivity problems
2. O(n × α(n)) is nearly linear - very efficient
3. First edge connecting connected components is redundant
4. DFS alternative exists but Union-Find is cleaner

## Solution Approach

This problem requires finding the edge that creates a cycle in an undirected graph. Since the graph started as a tree (connected, no cycles) and one edge was added, there is exactly one cycle. We need to find and return the redundant edge.

### Key Insights:

1. **Cycle Detection**: The redundant edge is the one that connects two nodes already in the same connected component
2. **Union-Find (DSU)**: Efficiently detect cycles by checking if two nodes are already connected before adding an edge
3. **DFS Approach**: Build graph and use DFS to detect cycles, then find the last edge in the cycle
4. **Last Edge Priority**: If multiple edges form cycles, return the one that appears last in the input

### Algorithm Options:

1. **DSU Approach**: Process edges in order, return first edge that connects already-connected nodes
2. **DFS Approach**: Build graph, find cycle, return last edge in cycle that appears in input

## Solution 1: Union-Find (DSU) - Recommended

### **Solution: DSU with Union by Rank**

```python
class DSU:
list[int> parent
list[int> rank
DSU(n) :
parent.resize(n)
rank.resize(n, 0)
for(i = 0 i < n i += 1) :
parent[i] = i
def find(self, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent[x])
    return parent[x]
def unite(self, x, y):
    x = find(x)
    y = find(y)
    if(x == y) return False
    if rank[x] < rank[y]:
        parent[x] = y
         else if(rank[x] > rank[y]) :
        parent[y] = x
         else :
        parent[y] = x
        rank[x]++
    return True
class Solution:
def findRedundantConnection(self, edges):
    n = len(edges)
    DSU dsu(n)
    for edge in edges:
        if not dsu.unite(edge[0] - 1, edge[1] - 1):
            return edge
    return :

```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **DSU Initialization (Lines 8-15)**:
   - `parent[i] = i`: Each node is its own parent initially
   - `rank[i] = 0`: All trees start with rank 0

2. **Find with Path Compression (Lines 17-22)**:
   - Recursively find root parent
   - Path compression: `parent[x] = find(parent[x])` flattens tree
   - Returns root of the set containing `x`

3. **Union by Rank (Lines 24-38)**:
   - Find roots of both nodes
   - If same root: already connected → return `false` (cycle detected!)
   - If different roots: merge sets using union by rank
   - Attach smaller tree to larger tree to keep balanced

4. **Main Solution (Lines 41-51)**:
   - Process edges in order
   - Convert 1-based to 0-based indexing: `edge[0] - 1, edge[1] - 1`
   - If `unite` returns `false`: nodes already connected → cycle found!
   - Return the redundant edge immediately

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]`:**

```
Initial: parent = [0,1,2], rank = [0,0,0]

Edge [1,2]: unite(0, 1)
- find(0) = 0, find(1) = 1 (different roots)
- rank[0] == rank[1] → parent[1] = 0, rank[0]++
- parent = [0,0,2], rank = [1,0,0]
- Return true (no cycle)

Edge [1,3]: unite(0, 2)
- find(0) = 0, find(2) = 2 (different roots)
- rank[0] > rank[2] → parent[2] = 0
- parent = [0,0,0], rank = [1,0,0]
- Return true (no cycle)

Edge [2,3]: unite(1, 2)
- find(1) = 0, find(2) = 0 (same root!)
- Return false → CYCLE DETECTED!
- Return [2,3]
```

## Solution 2: DFS Cycle Detection

### **Solution: DFS to Find Cycle**

```python
class Solution:
cycleStart = -1
def dfs(self, src, visited, list[list[pair<int, adjList, parent):
    visited[src] = True
    for p in adjList[src]:
        adj = p.first
        if not visited[adj]:
            parent[adj] = src
            dfs(adj, visited, adjList, parent)
             else if(adj != parent[src] * and  cycleStart == -1) :
            cycleStart = adj
            parent[adj] = src
def findRedundantConnection(self, edges):
    n = len(edges)
    list[bool> visited(n, False)
    list[int> parent(n, -1)
    list[list[pair<int, int>>> adjList(n)
    for edge in edges:
        u = edge[0] - 1
        v = edge[1] - 1
        adjList[u].append(:v, 0)
        adjList[v].append(:u, 0)
    dfs(0, visited, adjList, parent)
    dict[int, int> cycleNode
    node = cycleStart
    do :
    cycleNode[node] = 1
    node = parent[node]
     while node != cycleStart:
    for(i = len(edges) - 1 i >= 0 i -= 1) :
    if(cycleNode[edges[i][0] - 1] * and
    cycleNode[edges[i][1] - 1]) :
    return edges[i]
return :

```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Graph Construction (Lines 25-32)**:
   - Build adjacency list from edges
   - Convert 1-based to 0-based indexing
   - Store bidirectional edges

2. **DFS Cycle Detection (Lines 4-16)**:
   - Perform DFS from node 0
   - Track parent for each node
   - If visiting an already-visited node that's not the parent: cycle found!
   - Mark `cycleStart` when cycle detected

3. **Cycle Extraction (Lines 33-38)**:
   - Start from `cycleStart`
   - Follow parent pointers to extract all nodes in cycle
   - Store cycle nodes in `cycleNode` map

4. **Find Last Edge in Cycle (Lines 39-44)**:
   - Iterate edges from end to beginning
   - Find first edge where both endpoints are in cycle
   - Return that edge (last in input order)

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]`:**

```
Graph:
1 -- 2
|    |
3 ---|

DFS from node 0:
- Visit 0 (node 1), parent[0] = -1
- Visit 1 (node 2), parent[1] = 0
- Visit 2 (node 3), parent[2] = 1
- From 2, try to visit 0 (node 1)
  - 0 is visited and 0 != parent[2] (1) → CYCLE!
  - cycleStart = 0

Extract cycle:
- Start from 0: cycleNode[0] = 1
- parent[0] = -1? No, wait... parent[0] was set to 2 in cycle detection
- Follow: 0 → 2 → 1 → 0
- cycleNode = {0, 1, 2}

Find last edge in cycle:
- Check edges from end: [2,3] → nodes 1,2 both in cycle → Return [2,3]
```

## DSU Template

Here's the general template for Union-Find (DSU) with union by rank:

```python
class DSU:
list[int> parent
list[int> rank
DSU(n) :
parent.resize(n)
rank.resize(n, 0)
for(i = 0 i < n i += 1) :
parent[i] = i
# Find with path compression
def find(self, x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent[x]) # Path compression
    return parent[x]
# Union by rank
def unite(self, x, y):
    x = find(x)
    y = find(y)
    if(x == y) return False # Already in same set
    # Union by rank: attach smaller tree to larger tree
    if rank[x] < rank[y]:
        parent[x] = y
         else if(rank[x] > rank[y]) :
        parent[y] = x
         else :
        parent[y] = x
        rank[x]++
    return True
# Check if two nodes are connected
def connected(self, x, y):
    return find(x) == find(y)

```

### **Key Template Components:**

1. **Data Structures**:
   - `parent[i]`: Parent of node `i` (root if `parent[i] == i`)
   - `rank[i]`: Approximate depth of tree rooted at `i`

2. **Path Compression**:
   - Flattens tree during find operation
   - Makes future finds faster

3. **Union by Rank**:
   - Keeps trees balanced
   - Attaches smaller tree to larger tree
   - Only increases rank when ranks are equal

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - Nearly O(1) per operation (inverse Ackermann function)
   - O(α(n)) where α grows extremely slowly

## Complexity Analysis

### **Solution 1: DSU**

**Time Complexity:** O(n × α(n)) ≈ O(n)
- **DSU operations**: O(α(n)) per operation (nearly constant)
- **Process n edges**: O(n × α(n))
- **Total**: O(n) for practical purposes

**Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Parent array**: O(n)
- **Rank array**: O(n)
- **Total**: O(n)

### **Solution 2: DFS**

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Graph construction**: O(n)
- **DFS traversal**: O(n) - visit each node once
- **Cycle extraction**: O(n) - worst case
- **Edge search**: O(n) - check all edges
- **Total**: O(n)

**Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Adjacency list**: O(n)
- **Visited array**: O(n)
- **Parent array**: O(n)
- **Cycle node map**: O(n)
- **DFS recursion stack**: O(n)
- **Total**: O(n)

## Key Points

1. **DSU is Optimal**: Union-Find is the most efficient approach for cycle detection
2. **Path Compression**: Speeds up find operations significantly
3. **Union by Rank**: Keeps trees balanced for better performance
4. **1-based to 0-based**: Convert node indices when using DSU
5. **Last Edge Priority**: Problem asks for last edge in input that creates cycle
6. **Single Cycle**: Graph has exactly one cycle (one extra edge in tree)

## Comparison: DSU vs DFS

| Aspect | DSU | DFS |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Time Complexity** | O(n × α(n)) ≈ O(n) | O(n) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Implementation** | Simpler | More complex |
| **Cycle Detection** | Direct (during union) | Requires traversal |
| **Edge Order** | Natural (process in order) | Need to track and search |
| **Recommended** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Works but more complex |

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: DSU (Current Solution 1)**
- **Time**: O(n × α(n)) ≈ O(n)
- **Space**: O(n)
- **Best for**: Cycle detection in undirected graphs

### **Approach 2: DFS (Current Solution 2)**
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(n)
- **Use case**: When you need to extract full cycle information

### **Approach 3: BFS Cycle Detection**
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(n)
- **Similar to DFS**: Can detect cycles but more complex
