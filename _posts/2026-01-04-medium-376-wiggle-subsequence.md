# 376. Wiggle Subsequence

## Problem Statement

A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative.

- For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a **wiggle sequence** because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.
- In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of the longest **wiggle subsequence** of* `nums`*.*

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence because differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest wiggle subsequence is [1, 2] or [1, 9] with difference 1 or 8.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Wiggle definition**: What makes a sequence "wiggle"? (Assumption: Differences between consecutive elements alternate between positive and negative - up-down-up or down-up-down pattern)

2. **Subsequence definition**: Does subsequence need to be contiguous? (Assumption: No - subsequence maintains relative order but can skip elements)

3. **Length requirement**: What is the minimum length of a wiggle subsequence? (Assumption: Length 1 is valid, length 2 is valid if numbers differ)

4. **Equal values**: What if consecutive elements are equal? (Assumption: Equal values break the wiggle pattern - need to skip them or clarify handling)

5. **Return value**: Should we return the length or the subsequence itself? (Assumption: Return the length - integer representing longest wiggle subsequence length)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Try all possible subsequences and check which ones are wiggle sequences. For each subsequence, verify it alternates between increasing and decreasing. This approach has exponential complexity as we try all 2^n subsequences, which is infeasible for large arrays.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming: dp[i][direction] = longest wiggle subsequence ending at index i with given direction (up or down). For each position, check all previous positions and update dp based on whether we can extend the wiggle sequence. This requires O(n²) time and O(n) space, which works but can be optimized further.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use greedy approach: track the current direction (up or down) and the last element in the wiggle sequence. For each new element, if it continues the wiggle pattern (e.g., was going up, now going down), extend the sequence. If it breaks the pattern, decide whether to replace the last element (if it's better) or skip. Alternatively, count the number of direction changes: whenever the difference changes sign (positive to negative or vice versa), we have a wiggle. This achieves O(n) time with O(1) space, which is optimal. The key insight is that we only need to track the last direction and the last value, not all previous states.

## Solution Approach

This is a **greedy algorithm** problem. The key insight is to count the number of times the difference between consecutive elements changes sign. We only need to track when the sign alternates, not the actual values.

### Key Insights:

1. **Difference Tracking**: Track the difference between consecutive elements
2. **Sign Alternation**: Count when the sign of the difference changes
3. **Greedy Choice**: Include an element if it causes a sign change
4. **Skip Equal Elements**: If difference is 0, don't count it (no sign change)

### Algorithm:

1. **Handle Edge Cases**: If array has less than 2 elements, return its length
2. **Initialize**: Calculate first difference, set count to 2 if non-zero, else 1
3. **Process Remaining**: For each element, calculate difference and check if sign alternates
4. **Count Alternations**: Increment count when sign changes

## Solution

### **Solution: Greedy with Difference Tracking**

```python
class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums):
        N = len(nums)
        if N < 2:
            return N

        prevDiff = nums[1] - nums[0]

        rtn = 2 if prevDiff != 0 else 1

        for i in range(2, N):
            diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]

            if (diff > 0 and prevDiff <= 0) or (diff < 0 and prevDiff >= 0):
                rtn += 1
                prevDiff = diff

        return rtn
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Edge Case Check (Lines 4-5)**:
   - If array has less than 2 elements, return its length
   - Single element is always a valid wiggle sequence

2. **Initialize (Lines 7-8)**:
   - `prevDiff`: Difference between first two elements
   - `rtn`: Length of wiggle subsequence
     - If `prevDiff != 0`: Start with 2 elements (both are part of wiggle)
     - If `prevDiff == 0`: Start with 1 element (only first element counts)

3. **Process Remaining Elements (Lines 9-16)**:
   - **For each element** from index 2 to end:
     - **Calculate difference**: `diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]`
     - **Check sign alternation**:
       - **If `diff > 0` and `prevDiff <= 0`**: Sign changed from non-positive to positive
       - **If `diff < 0` and `prevDiff >= 0`**: Sign changed from non-negative to negative
     - **If sign alternates**:
       - Increment count: `rtn++`
       - Update previous difference: `prevDiff = diff`
     - **If sign doesn't alternate**: Skip this element (don't update `prevDiff`)

4. **Return (Line 17)**:
   - Return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence

### **Why This Works:**

**Key Insight**: We only need to count elements where the difference sign alternates. Elements that don't cause a sign change can be skipped.

**Greedy Choice**: 
- If the current difference has a different sign than the previous difference, include the element
- This locally optimal choice (include when sign changes) leads to a globally optimal solution

**Why Skip Equal Differences**:
- If `diff == 0`, there's no sign change, so we don't include the element
- We also don't update `prevDiff` when `diff == 0`, so we keep the last non-zero difference

**Example Walkthrough:**

**Example 1: `nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]`**

**Execution:**
```
Initial: N = 6
prevDiff = nums[1] - nums[0] = 7 - 1 = 6 (positive)
rtn = 2 (since prevDiff != 0)

i=2: nums[2]=4
  diff = 4 - 7 = -3 (negative)
  Check: diff < 0 && prevDiff >= 0? Yes (-3 < 0 && 6 >= 0)
  rtn = 2 + 1 = 3
  prevDiff = -3
  State: rtn=3, prevDiff=-3

i=3: nums[3]=9
  diff = 9 - 4 = 5 (positive)
  Check: diff > 0 && prevDiff <= 0? Yes (5 > 0 && -3 <= 0)
  rtn = 3 + 1 = 4
  prevDiff = 5
  State: rtn=4, prevDiff=5

i=4: nums[4]=2
  diff = 2 - 9 = -7 (negative)
  Check: diff < 0 && prevDiff >= 0? Yes (-7 < 0 && 5 >= 0)
  rtn = 4 + 1 = 5
  prevDiff = -7
  State: rtn=5, prevDiff=-7

i=5: nums[5]=5
  diff = 5 - 2 = 3 (positive)
  Check: diff > 0 && prevDiff <= 0? Yes (3 > 0 && -7 <= 0)
  rtn = 5 + 1 = 6
  prevDiff = 3
  State: rtn=6, prevDiff=3

Result: 6
Wiggle sequence: [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]
Differences: (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) - all alternate
```

**Example 2: `nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]`**

**Execution:**
```
Initial: N = 10
prevDiff = 17 - 1 = 16 (positive)
rtn = 2

i=2: nums[2]=5
  diff = 5 - 17 = -12 (negative)
  Check: diff < 0 && prevDiff >= 0? Yes
  rtn = 3, prevDiff = -12

i=3: nums[3]=10
  diff = 10 - 5 = 5 (positive)
  Check: diff > 0 && prevDiff <= 0? Yes
  rtn = 4, prevDiff = 5

i=4: nums[4]=13
  diff = 13 - 10 = 3 (positive)
  Check: diff > 0 && prevDiff <= 0? No (both positive)
  Skip (don't update prevDiff)

i=5: nums[5]=15
  diff = 15 - 13 = 2 (positive)
  Check: diff > 0 && prevDiff <= 0? No (prevDiff is still 5, positive)
  Skip

i=6: nums[6]=10
  diff = 10 - 15 = -5 (negative)
  Check: diff < 0 && prevDiff >= 0? Yes (prevDiff is 5, positive)
  rtn = 5, prevDiff = -5

i=7: nums[7]=5
  diff = 5 - 10 = -5 (negative)
  Check: diff < 0 && prevDiff >= 0? No (both negative)
  Skip

i=8: nums[8]=16
  diff = 16 - 5 = 11 (positive)
  Check: diff > 0 && prevDiff <= 0? Yes
  rtn = 6, prevDiff = 11

i=9: nums[9]=8
  diff = 8 - 16 = -8 (negative)
  Check: diff < 0 && prevDiff >= 0? Yes
  rtn = 7, prevDiff = -8

Result: 7
Wiggle sequence: [1, 17, 5, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] (or similar)
```

**Example 3: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`**

**Execution:**
```
Initial: N = 9
prevDiff = 2 - 1 = 1 (positive)
rtn = 2

i=2: nums[2]=3
  diff = 3 - 2 = 1 (positive)
  Check: diff > 0 && prevDiff <= 0? No (both positive)
  Skip

i=3: nums[3]=4
  diff = 4 - 3 = 1 (positive)
  Check: diff > 0 && prevDiff <= 0? No
  Skip

... (all differences are positive, so no sign changes)

Result: 2
Wiggle sequence: [1, 2] or [1, 9]
```

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Why Greedy Works**

**Greedy Choice Property**: At each position, if the sign of the difference alternates, include the element. This is optimal because:
1. **No Regret**: Including an element that causes a sign change always increases the wiggle length
2. **Optimal Substructure**: The longest wiggle subsequence ending at position `i` depends only on the last sign
3. **Local Optimality**: Making the locally optimal choice (include when sign changes) leads to global optimum

### **Why Skip Equal Differences**

**Zero Difference**: When `diff == 0`, there's no sign change, so:
- We don't include the element in the wiggle sequence
- We don't update `prevDiff` (keep the last non-zero difference)
- This allows us to "skip" equal elements and wait for the next sign change

**Example**: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3]`
- Differences: `(1, 0, 1)`
- We skip the middle `2` (diff = 0)
- Result: `[1, 2, 3]` with differences `(1, 1)` - but wait, that's not a wiggle...

Actually, let me reconsider. If we have `[1, 2, 2, 3]`:
- `prevDiff = 1` (positive)
- At `2, 2`: `diff = 0`, we skip, `prevDiff` stays `1`
- At `2, 3`: `diff = 1` (positive), same sign as `prevDiff`, so we skip
- Result: `[1, 2, 3]` is not a wiggle, but the algorithm returns 2 (correct: `[1, 2]` or `[1, 3]`)

### **Sign Alternation Logic**

**Condition**: `(diff > 0 && prevDiff <= 0) || (diff < 0 && prevDiff >= 0)`

**Why `<=` and `>=` instead of `<` and `>`?**
- We want to count when sign changes from non-positive to positive, or non-negative to negative
- This handles the case where `prevDiff == 0` (we want to count the first non-zero difference after zeros)
- Example: `[1, 1, 2]` → differences: `(0, 1)`
  - `prevDiff = 0`, `diff = 1`
  - `diff > 0 && prevDiff <= 0` → true, so we count it

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of `nums`
  - Single pass through the array
  - Each iteration does O(1) work
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using a few variables (`prevDiff`, `rtn`, `diff`, `i`)
  - No additional data structures

## Key Points

1. **Greedy Algorithm**: Count elements where difference sign alternates
2. **Difference Tracking**: Track the sign of differences, not the values
3. **Skip Zeros**: Don't count elements with zero difference
4. **Sign Alternation**: Use `<=` and `>=` to handle zero differences correctly
5. **Optimal**: This greedy strategy finds the longest wiggle subsequence

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: Greedy with Difference Tracking (Current Solution)**
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Best for**: Optimal solution, most efficient

### **Approach 2: Dynamic Programming**
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(n)
- **Idea**: Track two states: `up[i]` (ending with up) and `down[i]` (ending with down)
- **Code**:
```python
class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)

        up = [1] * n
        down = [1] * n

        for i in range(1, n):
            if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
                up[i] = down[i - 1] + 1
                down[i] = down[i - 1]

            elif nums[i] < nums[i - 1]:
                down[i] = up[i - 1] + 1
                up[i] = up[i - 1]

            else:
                up[i] = up[i - 1]
                down[i] = down[i - 1]

        return max(up[n - 1], down[n - 1])
```

### **Approach 3: Space-Optimized DP**
- **Time**: O(n)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Idea**: Only track `up` and `down` for current position (similar to greedy)

## Edge Cases

1. **Single element**: `[1]` → return 1
2. **Two elements (different)**: `[1, 2]` → return 2
3. **Two elements (same)**: `[1, 1]` → return 1
4. **All increasing**: `[1,2,3,4,5]` → return 2
5. **All decreasing**: `[5,4,3,2,1]` → return 2
6. **All equal**: `[1,1,1,1]` → return 1
7. **Perfect wiggle**: `[1,7,4,9,2,5]` → return 6

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong sign check**: Using `>` and `<` instead of `>=` and `<=`
2. **Not handling zeros**: Forgetting to skip elements with zero difference
3. **Not updating prevDiff**: Updating `prevDiff` even when sign doesn't change
4. **Wrong initialization**: Not handling the case where first difference is zero
5. **Off-by-one errors**: Incorrect loop bounds or initialization

## Follow-Up: Why `<=` and `>=` Instead of `<` and `>`?

**Question**: Why do we use `prevDiff <= 0` and `prevDiff >= 0` instead of `prevDiff < 0` and `prevDiff > 0`?

**Answer**:
- We want to count the **first non-zero difference** after a sequence of zeros
- If `prevDiff == 0`, we haven't established a sign yet
- When we see the first non-zero difference, we should count it
- Example: `[1, 1, 2]` → differences: `(0, 1)`
  - `prevDiff = 0`, `diff = 1`
  - With `prevDiff <= 0`: `1 > 0 && 0 <= 0` → true, count it ✓
  - With `prevDiff < 0`: `1 > 0 && 0 < 0` → false, don't count ✗

**Therefore**: Using `<=` and `>=` correctly handles the transition from zero to non-zero differences.
