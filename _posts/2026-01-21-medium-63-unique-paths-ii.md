# [Medium] 63. Unique Paths II

## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` and `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any square that is an obstacle**.

Return *the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[1,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The starting cell is blocked, so no path exists.
```

## Constraints

- `m == obstacleGrid.length`
- `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Obstacle representation**: How are obstacles represented in the grid? (Assumption: `1` represents an obstacle, `0` represents an empty cell)

2. **Starting/ending cells**: Can the start or end cell be an obstacle? (Assumption: If start or end is obstacle, return 0 - no path exists)

3. **Movement direction**: In which directions can we move? (Assumption: Only right and down - typical grid path problem constraint)

4. **Path uniqueness**: Do we need to find all unique paths or just count them? (Assumption: Just count the number of unique paths, not enumerate them)

5. **Grid boundaries**: Can we move outside the grid boundaries? (Assumption: No - must stay within grid bounds [0, m-1] x [0, n-1])

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Try all possible paths from start to end using recursive DFS. At each cell, try moving right and down (if valid and not obstacle). Count all paths that reach the destination. This approach has exponential complexity as we explore all possible paths, which is too slow for large grids.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming with memoization: dp[i][j] = number of paths from (0,0) to (i,j). Base cases: dp[0][0] = 1 if not obstacle, 0 otherwise. First row and column can only come from one direction. For other cells: if obstacle, dp[i][j] = 0; otherwise, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]. This requires O(m × n) time and space, which works well.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use bottom-up DP with space optimization. Since we only need the previous row to compute the current row, we can use a 1D array instead of 2D. Maintain dp[j] representing paths to current row, column j. Update: if obstacle, dp[j] = 0; otherwise, dp[j] += dp[j-1] (from left) and inherit from above (previous dp[j]). This achieves O(m × n) time with O(n) space, which is optimal for space. The key insight is that we only need the previous row's values to compute the current row, allowing space optimization from O(m × n) to O(n).

## Solution Approach

This is a **2D dynamic programming** problem similar to Unique Paths (LC 62), but with obstacles blocking certain cells. The key insight is that if a cell contains an obstacle, there are 0 ways to reach it.

### Key Insights:

1. **DP State**: `dp[i][j]` = number of unique paths to reach cell `(i, j)`
2. **Base Cases**: 
   - If `obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1`, return 0 (starting cell blocked)
   - `dp[0][0] = 1` if no obstacle
   - First row: can only come from left, but if obstacle encountered, all subsequent cells are 0
   - First column: can only come from top, but if obstacle encountered, all subsequent cells are 0
3. **Recurrence**: 
   - If `obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1`: `dp[i][j] = 0`
   - Otherwise: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`
4. **Answer**: `dp[m-1][n-1]` (bottom-right corner)

### Space Optimization:

We can optimize space from O(m×n) to O(n) by using a 1D array since we only need the previous row.

## Solution

### **Solution 1: Space-Optimized DP (O(n) space)**

```python
# if(i, j) = 0 if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1
# if(i, j) = f(i-1, j) + f(i, j-1), if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0

class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(obstacleGrid)
        n = len(obstacleGrid[0])

        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = 1 if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0 else 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1:
                    dp[j] = 0
                elif j > 0:
                    dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
        return dp[-1]

```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Initialize (Lines 8-9)**:
   - Get dimensions `N` (rows) and `M` (columns)
   - Initialize `dp` array of size `M` (columns) with zeros
   - Set `dp[0] = 1` if starting cell has no obstacle, else `0`

2. **Process Each Row (Lines 11-19)**:
   - For each row `i` from `0` to `N-1`:
     - For each column `j` from `0` to `M-1`:
       - **If obstacle (Line 13)**: Set `dp[j] = 0` (no paths through obstacle)
       - **Else if not first column (Line 15)**: `dp[j] += dp[j-1]`
         - This accumulates paths from left (`dp[j-1]`) with paths from top (already in `dp[j]`)

3. **Return (Line 20)**: `dp.back()` = `dp[M-1]` (number of paths to bottom-right)

### **Why This Works:**

- **Space Optimization**: Using 1D array `dp[j]` stores paths to current row
  - Before update: `dp[j]` = paths from top (previous row)
  - After `dp[j] += dp[j-1]`: `dp[j]` = paths from top + paths from left
- **Obstacle Handling**: When obstacle encountered, set `dp[j] = 0`, blocking all paths through that cell
- **Base Case**: `dp[0]` initialized based on starting cell
- **Row-by-Row Processing**: Each row processes left-to-right, accumulating paths correctly

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**For `obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]`:**

```
Initial: dp = [1, 0, 0]  (starting at (0,0))

Row 0 (i=0):
  j=0: obstacleGrid[0][0]=0, dp[0] stays 1
  j=1: obstacleGrid[0][1]=0, dp[1] += dp[0] → dp[1] = 1
  j=2: obstacleGrid[0][2]=0, dp[2] += dp[1] → dp[2] = 1
  dp = [1, 1, 1]

Row 1 (i=1):
  j=0: obstacleGrid[1][0]=0, dp[0] stays 1 (from top)
  j=1: obstacleGrid[1][1]=1, dp[1] = 0 (obstacle!)
  j=2: obstacleGrid[1][2]=0, dp[2] += dp[1] → dp[2] = 1 + 0 = 1
  dp = [1, 0, 1]

Row 2 (i=2):
  j=0: obstacleGrid[2][0]=0, dp[0] stays 1
  j=1: obstacleGrid[2][1]=0, dp[1] += dp[0] → dp[1] = 0 + 1 = 1
  j=2: obstacleGrid[2][2]=0, dp[2] += dp[1] → dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2
  dp = [1, 1, 2]

Result: 2 paths
```

### **Solution 2: 2D DP (O(m×n) space)**

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(obstacleGrid)
        n = len(obstacleGrid[0])

        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = 0
                elif i == 0 and j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    up = dp[i - 1][j] if i > 0 else 0
                    left = dp[i][j - 1] if j > 0 else 0
                    dp[i][j] = up + left
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
```

### **Complexity Analysis:**

**Solution 1 (Space-Optimized):**
- **Time Complexity:** O(m × n) - Visit each cell once
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - Single array of size `n` (number of columns)

**Solution 2 (2D DP):**
- **Time Complexity:** O(m × n) - Visit each cell once
- **Space Complexity:** O(m × n) - Full DP table

### **Key Differences from LC 62:**

1. **Obstacle Handling**: Check if cell is obstacle before calculating paths
2. **Base Case**: Starting cell might be blocked (return 0)
3. **Edge Cases**: First row/column can have obstacles blocking subsequent cells

### **Edge Cases:**

1. **Starting cell blocked**: `obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1` → return 0
2. **Ending cell blocked**: `obstacleGrid[m-1][n-1] == 1` → return 0
3. **Single cell**: `m == 1 && n == 1` → return 1 if no obstacle, else 0
4. **Entire row/column blocked**: Some paths become impossible

### **Common Mistakes:**

1. **Forgetting to check starting cell**: Must initialize `dp[0]` based on `obstacleGrid[0][0]`
2. **Not resetting obstacle cells**: When obstacle found, must set `dp[j] = 0` explicitly
3. **Incorrect space optimization**: In 1D version, must handle first column separately (no `j > 0` check for `dp[0]`)
