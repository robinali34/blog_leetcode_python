# [Medium] 1029. Two City Scheduling

## Problem Statement

A company is planning to interview `2n` people. Given the array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti]`, the cost of flying the `i`-th person to city `a` is `aCosti`, and the cost of flying the `i`-th person to city `b` is `bCosti`.

Return *the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly `n` people arrive in each city*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.
The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]
Output: 1859
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: costs = [[515,563],[451,713],[537,709],[343,819],[855,779],[457,60],[650,359],[631,42]]
Output: 3086
```

## Constraints

- `2 * n == costs.length`
- `2 <= costs.length <= 100`
- `costs.length` is even
- `1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Scheduling requirement**: What is the scheduling requirement? (Assumption: Send exactly n people to city A and n people to city B - equal distribution)

2. **Cost format**: How are costs represented? (Assumption: costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti] - cost to send person i to city A and city B)

3. **Optimization goal**: What are we optimizing for? (Assumption: Minimum total cost to send n people to each city)

4. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - minimum total cost)

5. **Person assignment**: Can we choose which people go to which city? (Assumption: Yes - can assign any person to either city, but must have exactly n in each)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Try all possible ways to select n people for city A (and remaining n for city B). For each selection, calculate the total cost and find the minimum. This requires checking C(2n, n) combinations, which has exponential complexity and is infeasible for large n.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming: dp[i][a_count] = minimum cost to assign first i people with a_count going to city A. For each person, decide to send to city A or B. This requires O(n²) time and space, which works but can be optimized further.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use greedy approach: calculate the "savings" for each person if sent to city A instead of B (costB - costA). Sort people by savings in descending order. Send the first n people (with highest savings) to city A, and the rest to city B. This works because we want to maximize savings by sending people with highest cost difference to the cheaper city. This achieves O(n log n) time for sorting plus O(n) for calculation, which is optimal. The key insight is that the problem reduces to: send n people to city A where sending them to A saves the most money compared to sending them to B.

## Solution Approach

This is a **greedy algorithm** problem with a key mathematical insight. The crucial observation is to sort people by the **difference** between their costs to the two cities, which indicates which city is cheaper for each person.

### Key Insights:

1. **Cost Difference**: For each person, calculate `cost[0] - cost[1]`
   - **Negative difference**: Cheaper to send to city A (cost[0] < cost[1])
   - **Positive difference**: Cheaper to send to city B (cost[0] > cost[1])
   - **Zero difference**: Same cost to both cities

2. **Sorting Strategy**: Sort by `cost[0] - cost[1]` in ascending order
   - First `n` people (smallest differences) → send to city A
   - Last `n` people (largest differences) → send to city B

3. **Optimal**: This greedy strategy minimizes total cost

### Algorithm:

1. **Sort**: Sort `costs` by `cost[0] - cost[1]` in ascending order
2. **Assign**: 
   - First `n` people → city A (cost[0])
   - Last `n` people → city B (cost[1])
3. **Sum**: Return total cost

## Solution

### **Solution: Greedy with Sorting by Difference**

```python
class Solution:
    def twoCitySchedCost(self, costs):
        costs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0])

        total = 0
        n = len(costs) // 2

        for i in range(n):
            total += costs[i][1] + costs[i + n][0]

        return total
```

### **Algorithm Explanation:**

1. **Sort by Cost Difference (Lines 4-6)**:
   - Sort `costs` by `cost[0] - cost[1]` in ascending order
   - Custom comparator: `u[0] - u[1] < v[0] - v[1]`
   - **Why**: People with smaller differences (cheaper to send to A) come first
   - **Why**: People with larger differences (cheaper to send to B) come last

2. **Initialize (Lines 7-8)**:
   - `total`: Total cost (starts at 0)
   - `N`: Half the number of people (`costs.size() / 2`)

3. **Assign and Sum (Lines 9-12)**:
   - **For first `N` people** (`i = 0` to `N-1`):
     - Add `costs[i][0]` (send to city A)
   - **For last `N` people** (`i = N` to `2N-1`):
     - Add `costs[i + N][1]` (send to city B)
   - **Note**: `costs[i + N]` accesses the `(i+N)`-th element, which is in the second half

4. **Return (Line 13)**:
   - Return the total cost

### **Why This Works:**

**Key Insight**: The difference `cost[0] - cost[1]` tells us the "savings" from sending a person to city A instead of city B.

**Strategy**:
1. **Sort by difference**: People with negative differences (cheaper to A) come first
2. **Send first N to A**: These people save money by going to A
3. **Send last N to B**: These people save money by going to B (or lose less)
4. **Optimal**: This maximizes total savings

**Mathematical Proof**:
- If we send person `i` to city A: cost = `costs[i][0]`
- If we send person `i` to city B: cost = `costs[i][1]`
- Savings from sending to A: `costs[i][1] - costs[i][0] = -(costs[i][0] - costs[i][1])`
- To maximize savings, send people with largest `(costs[i][1] - costs[i][0])` to A
- Equivalently, send people with smallest `(costs[i][0] - costs[i][1])` to A

**Example Walkthrough:**

**Example 1: `costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]`**

**Calculate differences:**
```
Person 0: [10, 20] → difference = 10 - 20 = -10 (cheaper to A)
Person 1: [30, 200] → difference = 30 - 200 = -170 (cheaper to A)
Person 2: [400, 50] → difference = 400 - 50 = 350 (cheaper to B)
Person 3: [30, 20] → difference = 30 - 20 = 10 (cheaper to B)
```

**After sorting by difference (ascending):**
```
Sorted: [[30, 200], [10, 20], [30, 20], [400, 50]]
        (diff=-170)  (diff=-10)  (diff=10)  (diff=350)
```

**Execution:**
```
N = 4 / 2 = 2

First N (i=0,1): Send to city A
  i=0: costs[0][0] = 30
  i=1: costs[1][0] = 10

Last N (i=0,1): Send to city B
  i=0: costs[0+2][1] = costs[2][1] = 20
  i=1: costs[1+2][1] = costs[3][1] = 50

Total = 30 + 10 + 20 + 50 = 110
```

**Verification:**
```
Person 0: [30, 200] → Send to A: 30 ✓
Person 1: [10, 20] → Send to A: 10 ✓
Person 2: [30, 20] → Send to B: 20 ✓
Person 3: [400, 50] → Send to B: 50 ✓
Total: 30 + 10 + 20 + 50 = 110
```

**Example 2: `costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]`**

**Calculate differences:**
```
Person 0: [259, 770] → diff = 259 - 770 = -511
Person 1: [448, 54] → diff = 448 - 54 = 394
Person 2: [926, 667] → diff = 926 - 667 = 259
Person 3: [184, 139] → diff = 184 - 139 = 45
Person 4: [840, 118] → diff = 840 - 118 = 722
Person 5: [577, 469] → diff = 577 - 469 = 108
```

**After sorting by difference (ascending):**
```
Sorted: [[259, 770], [184, 139], [577, 469], [926, 667], [448, 54], [840, 118]]
        (diff=-511)  (diff=45)   (diff=108)  (diff=259)  (diff=394)  (diff=722)
```

**Execution:**
```
N = 6 / 2 = 3

First N (i=0,1,2): Send to city A
  i=0: costs[0][0] = 259
  i=1: costs[1][0] = 184
  i=2: costs[2][0] = 577

Last N (i=0,1,2): Send to city B
  i=0: costs[0+3][1] = costs[3][1] = 667
  i=1: costs[1+3][1] = costs[4][1] = 54
  i=2: costs[2+3][1] = costs[5][1] = 118

Total = 259 + 184 + 577 + 667 + 54 + 118 = 1859
```

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Why Sorting by Difference Works**

**Key Insight**: The difference `cost[0] - cost[1]` represents the "penalty" for choosing city A over city B.

**Analysis**:
- **Negative difference** (`cost[0] - cost[1] < 0`): `cost[0] < cost[1]` → Cheaper to send to A
- **Positive difference** (`cost[0] - cost[1] > 0`): `cost[0] > cost[1]` → Cheaper to send to B
- **Zero difference** (`cost[0] - cost[1] = 0`): Same cost to both cities

**Sorting Strategy**:
- Sort by `cost[0] - cost[1]` in **ascending order**
- First half (smallest differences) → Send to city A (minimize penalty)
- Second half (largest differences) → Send to city B (minimize penalty)

### **Why This is Optimal**

**Greedy Choice Property**:
- For each person, we want to minimize their cost
- Sorting by difference ensures we make locally optimal choices
- The constraint (exactly N people to each city) is satisfied by the split

**Optimal Substructure**:
- After sorting, the problem reduces to: send first N to A, last N to B
- This is optimal because we're maximizing total savings

### **Alternative Interpretation**

**Cost Savings**:
- Savings from sending person `i` to A: `costs[i][1] - costs[i][0]`
- To maximize total savings, send people with largest savings to A
- Equivalently, send people with smallest `(costs[i][0] - costs[i][1])` to A

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) where n is the number of people
  - **Sorting**: O(n log n) - dominates the time complexity
  - **Summing**: O(n) - single pass through sorted array
  - **Total**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only using a few variables (`total`, `N`, `i`)
  - Sorting is typically in-place (O(1) extra space)

## Key Points

1. **Sort by Difference**: Sort by `cost[0] - cost[1]` to identify which city is cheaper
2. **Greedy Assignment**: Send first N to city A, last N to city B
3. **Optimal**: This greedy strategy minimizes total cost
4. **Simple**: Straightforward implementation after sorting
5. **Efficient**: O(n log n) time complexity

## Alternative Approaches

### **Approach 1: Greedy with Sorting (Current Solution)**
- **Time**: O(n log n)
- **Space**: O(1)
- **Best for**: Optimal solution, most efficient

### **Approach 2: Dynamic Programming**
- **Time**: O(n²)
- **Space**: O(n²)
- **Use when**: Need to track state (not needed here)
- **Overkill**: Greedy is optimal and simpler

### **Approach 3: Try All Combinations**
- **Time**: O(2^n)
- **Space**: O(n)
- **Not practical**: Too slow for large inputs

## Edge Cases

1. **All same cost**: `[[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4]]` → Any assignment works
2. **All cheaper to A**: `[[1,100],[2,200],[3,300],[4,400]]` → Send first 2 to A, last 2 to A (but constraint: need 2 to B)
3. **All cheaper to B**: `[[100,1],[200,2],[300,3],[400,4]]` → Send first 2 to A, last 2 to B
4. **Mixed**: `[[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]` → Example 1

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong sorting order**: Sorting in descending instead of ascending
2. **Wrong assignment**: Sending first N to B instead of A
3. **Index errors**: Incorrectly accessing `costs[i + N]`
4. **Not understanding difference**: Not realizing what the difference represents
5. **Forgetting constraint**: Not ensuring exactly N people to each city

## Follow-Up: Why Sort by Difference?

**Question**: Why does sorting by `cost[0] - cost[1]` work?

**Answer**:
- The difference tells us the "penalty" for choosing city A over city B
- **Negative difference**: Choosing A saves money (penalty is negative)
- **Positive difference**: Choosing A costs more (penalty is positive)
- By sorting in ascending order, we put people who save the most by going to A first
- We send the first N to A (maximize savings) and last N to B (minimize losses)

**Mathematical Formulation**:
- Total cost if we send person `i` to A: `costs[i][0]`
- Total cost if we send person `i` to B: `costs[i][1]`
- Difference: `costs[i][0] - costs[i][1]`
- If difference < 0: A is cheaper
- If difference > 0: B is cheaper
- Sorting by difference groups people by which city is cheaper for them
