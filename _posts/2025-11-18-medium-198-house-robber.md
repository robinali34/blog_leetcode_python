# [Medium] 198. House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. The only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9), and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Robbery rules**: What are the robbery rules? (Assumption: Cannot rob two adjacent houses - must skip at least one house between robberies)

2. **Optimization goal**: What are we optimizing for? (Assumption: Maximum money that can be robbed without alerting police)

3. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - maximum money that can be robbed)

4. **House values**: What do nums[i] represent? (Assumption: Amount of money in house i - positive integers)

5. **Empty array**: What if array is empty? (Assumption: Return 0 - no houses to rob)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

Try all possible combinations of houses to rob: for each house, decide whether to rob it or skip it, ensuring we never rob two adjacent houses. Use recursion to explore all possibilities and return the maximum money. This approach has exponential time complexity O(2^n), which is too slow for large arrays.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use recursion with memoization: for each position, compute the maximum money we can rob starting from that position. Memoize results to avoid recomputing the same subproblems. This reduces time to O(n) with O(n) space for memoization, but recursion overhead and stack space can be significant.

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach: `dp[i]` represents the maximum money we can rob from houses 0 to i. For each house i, we can either rob it (add nums[i] to dp[i-2]) or skip it (use dp[i-1]). The recurrence is `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])`. We can optimize space to O(1) by only keeping track of the last two values. This achieves O(n) time with O(1) space, which is optimal. The key insight is that this is a classic DP problem with overlapping subproblems, and we can solve it iteratively without recursion.

## Solution: Dynamic Programming

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - Single pass through the array  
**Space Complexity:** O(n) - DP array (can be optimized to O(1))

This is a classic dynamic programming problem. The key insight is that for each house, we have two choices:
1. **Rob it**: Add its value to the maximum from two houses ago
2. **Skip it**: Take the maximum from the previous house

### Solution: DP Array Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums):
        if len(nums) <= 0:
            return 0

        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]

        dp = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)

        dp[0] = 0
        dp[1] = nums[0]

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            dp[i + 1] = max(dp[i - 1] + nums[i], dp[i])

        return dp[len(nums)]
```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Step-by-Step Example: `nums = [2,7,9,3,1]`

```
Initial: dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = nums[0] = 2

i=1 (nums[1]=7):
  Option 1: Rob house 2 → dp[0] + nums[1] = 0 + 7 = 7
  Option 2: Skip house 2 → dp[1] = 2
  dp[2] = max(7, 2) = 7

i=2 (nums[2]=9):
  Option 1: Rob house 3 → dp[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 9 = 11
  Option 2: Skip house 3 → dp[2] = 7
  dp[3] = max(11, 7) = 11

i=3 (nums[3]=3):
  Option 1: Rob house 4 → dp[2] + nums[3] = 7 + 3 = 10
  Option 2: Skip house 4 → dp[3] = 11
  dp[4] = max(10, 11) = 11

i=4 (nums[4]=1):
  Option 1: Rob house 5 → dp[3] + nums[4] = 11 + 1 = 12
  Option 2: Skip house 5 → dp[4] = 11
  dp[5] = max(12, 11) = 12

Result: dp[5] = 12
```

### Visual Representation

```
Houses:    [2]  [7]  [9]  [3]  [1]
Indices:    0    1    2    3    4

DP State:
dp[0] = 0                    (no houses)
dp[1] = 2                    (rob house 0)
dp[2] = max(0+7, 2) = 7      (rob house 1, skip house 0)
dp[3] = max(2+9, 7) = 11     (rob house 2, skip house 1)
dp[4] = max(7+3, 11) = 11    (skip house 3, keep previous)
dp[5] = max(11+1, 11) = 12   (rob house 4)

Optimal path: Rob houses 0, 2, 4 → 2 + 9 + 1 = 12
```

## Key Insights

1. **DP State Definition**: `dp[i]` represents the maximum money robbed up to house `i-1` (1-indexed)
2. **Recurrence Relation**: `dp[i+1] = max(dp[i-1] + nums[i], dp[i])`
   - `dp[i-1] + nums[i]`: Rob current house (can't rob previous)
   - `dp[i]`: Skip current house (keep previous maximum)
3. **Base Cases**: 
   - `dp[0] = 0` (no houses)
   - `dp[1] = nums[0]` (only first house)
4. **1-Indexed DP Array**: Using `dp[i+1]` makes indexing cleaner and avoids edge cases

## Algorithm Breakdown

```python
def rob(self, nums):
    # Edge cases
    if(len(nums) <= 0) return 0
    if(len(nums) == 1) return nums[0]
    # DP array: dp[i] = max money up to house i-1
    list[int> dp(len(nums) + 1)
    dp[0] = 0        # No houses
    dp[1] = nums[0]  # Only first house
    # For each house starting from index 1
    for(i = 1 i < (int)len(nums) i += 1) :
    # Choose: rob current house OR skip it
    dp[i + 1] = max(
    dp[i - 1] + nums[i],  # Rob current (skip previous)
    dp[i]                  # Skip current (keep previous max)
    )
return dp[len(nums)]  # Maximum for all houses

```

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty array**: `nums = []` → return `0`
2. **Single house**: `nums = [5]` → return `5`
3. **Two houses**: `nums = [2,1]` → return `max(2,1) = 2`
4. **All zeros**: `nums = [0,0,0]` → return `0`
5. **Alternating pattern**: `nums = [1,2,1,2]` → return `max(1+1, 2+2) = 4`

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 2: Space-Optimized O(1) Space

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

Instead of storing the entire DP array, we only need the previous two values:

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums):
        if not nums:
            return 0

        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]

        prev2 = 0        # dp[i-2]
        prev1 = nums[0]  # dp[i-1]

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            current = max(prev2 + nums[i], prev1)
            prev2 = prev1
            prev1 = current

        return prev1
```

**Pros:**
- O(1) space complexity
- Same time complexity
- More memory efficient

**Cons:**
- Slightly less intuitive
- Can't trace back the optimal path

### Approach 3: 0-Indexed DP Array

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Standard 0-indexed approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums):
        if not nums:
            return 0

        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]

        dp = [0] * len(nums)

        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])

        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i])

        return dp[len(nums) - 1]
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **DP Array (1-indexed)** | O(n) | O(n) | Clear indexing, easy to understand | O(n) space |
| **Space-Optimized** | O(n) | O(1) | Optimal space usage | Can't trace path |
| **DP Array (0-indexed)** | O(n) | O(n) | Standard DP pattern | Requires base case handling |

## Recurrence Relation Explanation

The core recurrence relation is:

```
dp[i+1] = max(dp[i-1] + nums[i], dp[i])
```

**Why this works:**
- **`dp[i-1] + nums[i]`**: If we rob house `i`, we can't rob house `i-1`, so we take the maximum from `i-2` (stored in `dp[i-1]`) and add current house value
- **`dp[i]`**: If we skip house `i`, we keep the maximum from all previous houses up to `i-1`

This ensures we never rob two adjacent houses while maximizing the total amount.

## Implementation Details

### 1-Indexed vs 0-Indexed

**1-Indexed (Your Solution):**
```python
dp[0] = 0           # No houses
dp[1] = nums[0]     # First house
dp[i+1] = max(...)  # Current house at index i
```

**0-Indexed (Standard):**
```python
dp[0] = nums[0]     # First house
dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])  # First two houses
dp[i] = max(...)    # Current house at index i
```

Both approaches are correct; 1-indexed makes base cases simpler.

### Type Casting

```python
for(i = 1 i < (int)len(nums) i += 1)

```

The `(int)` cast prevents comparison warnings between `int` and `size_t`. Alternatively:
```python
for(size_t i = 1 i < len(nums) i += 1)
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting edge cases**: Empty array or single element
2. **Wrong recurrence**: Using `dp[i-2]` instead of `dp[i-1]` for 1-indexed
3. **Index out of bounds**: Not handling base cases properly
4. **Wrong return value**: Returning `dp[nums.size()-1]` instead of `dp[nums.size()]` for 1-indexed
5. **Not considering skip option**: Only considering robbing current house

## Optimization Tips

1. **Space Optimization**: Use two variables instead of array for O(1) space
2. **Early Termination**: Can add checks for special cases
3. **Memoization**: For recursive approach, use memoization to avoid recomputation
4. **Bottom-Up DP**: Preferred over top-down for better cache performance
