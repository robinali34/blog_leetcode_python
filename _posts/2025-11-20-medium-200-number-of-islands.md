# [Medium] 200. Number of Islands

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

## Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Clarification Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are 5 important clarifications and assumptions to discuss during an interview:

1. **Island definition**: What is an island? (Assumption: Group of connected '1's - horizontally or vertically adjacent, not diagonally)

2. **Return value**: What should we return? (Assumption: Integer - count of islands in the grid)

3. **Connection rules**: How are cells connected? (Assumption: Horizontal or vertical adjacency - up, down, left, right)

4. **Grid modification**: Can we modify the grid? (Assumption: Yes - can mark visited cells to avoid revisiting)

5. **Empty grid**: What if grid is empty? (Assumption: Return 0 - no islands exist)

## Interview Deduction Process (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Brute-Force Approach (5 minutes)**

For each cell, if it's land ('1'), increment island count and mark all connected land cells as visited using DFS or BFS. Use a separate visited array to track which cells have been processed. This approach works but requires O(m × n) extra space for the visited array.

**Step 2: Semi-Optimized Approach (7 minutes)**

Use DFS with in-place marking: instead of a separate visited array, mark visited cells by changing '1' to '0' or another marker. This eliminates the need for extra space. However, we need to be careful not to modify the grid if that's not allowed (but the problem allows modification).

**Step 3: Optimized Solution (8 minutes)**

Use DFS with in-place marking: iterate through the grid. When we find a '1', increment island count and perform DFS to mark all connected '1's as visited (change to '0' or '2'). This achieves O(m × n) time (each cell visited once) with O(1) extra space (if we modify the grid) or O(m × n) space for recursion stack. The key insight is that we can use the grid itself to mark visited cells, eliminating the need for a separate visited array and achieving optimal space complexity.

## Solution: DFS with In-Place Marking

**Time Complexity:** O(m × n) - Each cell is visited at most once  
**Space Complexity:** O(m × n) - Worst case recursion stack depth

This solution uses Depth-First Search to explore each island and marks visited cells by changing `'1'` to `'0'` to avoid revisiting.

### Solution: DFS In-Place Marking

```python
class Solution:
    def dfs(self, grid, row, col):
        if (row < 0 or col < 0 or row >= len(grid) or col >= len(grid[0]) or grid[row][col] != '1'):
            return

        grid[row][col] = '0'

        self.dfs(grid, row - 1, col)
        self.dfs(grid, row, col - 1)
        self.dfs(grid, row + 1, col)
        self.dfs(grid, row, col + 1)

    def numIslands(self, grid):
        if len(grid) == 0 or len(grid[0]) == 0:
            return 0

        cnt = 0

        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    self.dfs(grid, i, j)
                    cnt += 1

        return cnt
```

## How the Algorithm Works

### Step-by-Step Example: `grid = [["1","1","0","0","0"],["1","1","0","0","0"],["0","0","1","0","0"],["0","0","0","1","1"]]`

```
Initial Grid:
  0 1 2 3 4
0 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
2 0 0 1 0 0
3 0 0 0 1 1

i=0, j=0: Found '1' → Start DFS
  DFS(0,0): Mark (0,0) as '0'
    DFS(-1,0): Out of bounds, return
    DFS(0,-1): Out of bounds, return
    DFS(1,0): Found '1' → Mark (1,0) as '0'
      DFS(0,0): Already '0', return
      DFS(1,-1): Out of bounds, return
      DFS(2,0): Found '0', return
      DFS(1,1): Found '1' → Mark (1,1) as '0'
        DFS(0,1): Found '1' → Mark (0,1) as '0'
          ... (explore all connected)
    DFS(0,1): Already '0', return
  cnt = 1

i=0, j=2: Found '0', skip
i=0, j=3: Found '0', skip
...
i=2, j=2: Found '1' → Start DFS
  DFS(2,2): Mark (2,2) as '0'
    ... (explore all connected)
  cnt = 2

i=3, j=3: Found '1' → Start DFS
  DFS(3,3): Mark (3,3) as '0'
    DFS(3,4): Found '1' → Mark (3,4) as '0'
      ... (explore all connected)
  cnt = 3

Result: 3 islands
```

### Visual Representation

```
Island 1:        Island 2:    Island 3:
  1 1             1            1 1
  1 1             0            0 0
  0 0             0            0 0
```

## Key Insights

1. **Connected Components**: Each island is a connected component of '1's
2. **In-Place Marking**: Change '1' to '0' to mark visited cells (no extra visited array needed)
3. **DFS Exploration**: Use DFS to explore all connected land cells
4. **4-Directional**: Only check up, down, left, right (not diagonals)
5. **Count on Discovery**: Increment count when finding a new '1' (start of new island)

## Algorithm Breakdown

```python
def numIslands(self, grid):
    # Handle empty grid
    if (len(grid) == 0  or  grid[0].__len__() == 0) return 0
    cnt = 0
    # Scan entire grid
    for(i = 0 i < len(grid) i += 1) :
    for(j = 0 j < grid[0].__len__() j += 1) :
    # Found unvisited land cell
    if grid[i][j] == '1':
        # Explore entire island
        dfs(grid, i, j)
        # Count this island
        cnt += 1
return cnt
def dfs(self, grid, row, col):
    # Base cases: out of bounds or water/visited
    if (row < 0  or  col < 0  or
    row >= len(grid)  or  col >= grid[0].__len__()  or
    grid[row][col] != '1') :
    return
# Mark as visited by changing to '0'
grid[row][col] = '0'
# Explore all 4 directions
dfs(grid, row - 1, col)  # Up
dfs(grid, row, col - 1)   # Left
dfs(grid, row + 1, col)   # Down
dfs(grid, row, col + 1)   # Right

```

## Edge Cases

1. **Empty grid**: `[]` or `[[]]` → return `0`
2. **No islands**: All `'0'` → return `0`
3. **Single cell**: `[["1"]]` → return `1`
4. **Single row**: `[["1","1","0"]]` → return `1`
5. **Single column**: `[["1"],["1"],["0"]]` → return `1`
6. **All land**: Entire grid is `'1'` → return `1`

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 2: BFS (Breadth-First Search)

**Time Complexity:** O(m × n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(min(m, n)) - Queue size

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        if not grid or not grid[0]:
            return 0

        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])

        cnt = 0

        dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    cnt += 1

                    q = deque()
                    q.append((i, j))
                    grid[i][j] = '0'

                    while q:
                        r, c = q.popleft()

                        for dr, dc in dirs:
                            nr = r + dr
                            nc = c + dc

                            if (0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and grid[nr][nc] == '1'):
                                grid[nr][nc] = '0'
                                q.append((nr, nc))

        return cnt
```

**Pros:**
- Iterative (no recursion stack)
- Better space complexity for wide islands

**Cons:**
- More verbose
- Requires queue data structure

### Approach 3: Union-Find (Disjoint Set)

**Time Complexity:** O(m × n × α(m × n)) where α is inverse Ackermann  
**Space Complexity:** O(m × n)

```python
class Solution:
list[int> parent
def find(self, x):
    if parent[x] != x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]:
    return parent[x]
def unite(self, x, y):
    parent[find(x)] = find(y)
def numIslands(self, grid):
    if(not grid  or  grid[0].empty()) return 0
    m = len(grid), n = grid[0].__len__()
    parent.resize(m  n)
    iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0)
    islands = 0
    for(i = 0 i < m i += 1) :
    for(j = 0 j < n j += 1) :
    if grid[i][j] == '1':
        islands += 1
        idx = i  n + j
        if i > 0  and  grid[i-1][j] == '1':
            up = (i-1)  n + j
            if find(idx) != find(up):
                unite(idx, up)
                islands -= 1
        if j > 0  and  grid[i][j-1] == '1':
            left = i  n + (j-1)
            if find(idx) != find(left):
                unite(idx, left)
                islands -= 1
return islands

```

**Pros:**
- Useful for dynamic island problems
- Can handle online queries

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation
- Overkill for this problem

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time | Space | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|-------|------|------|
| **DFS In-Place** | O(m×n) | O(m×n) | Simple, intuitive | Recursion stack |
| **BFS** | O(m×n) | O(min(m,n)) | Iterative, better space | More verbose |
| **Union-Find** | O(m×n×α) | O(m×n) | Good for dynamic | Complex |

## Implementation Details

### Boundary Checking

```python
if (row < 0  or  col < 0  or
row >= (int)len(grid)  or  col >= (int)grid[0].__len__()  or
grid[row][col] != '1') :
return

```

**Why cast to `int`?**
- Prevents comparison warnings between `int` and `size_t`
- Ensures correct comparison behavior

### In-Place Marking

```python
grid[row][col] = '0'
```

**Why change to '0'?**
- Marks cell as visited without extra memory
- Prevents revisiting same cell
- Simplifies code (no separate visited array)

### Direction Exploration Order

```python
dfs(grid, row - 1, col)  # Up
dfs(grid, row, col - 1)  # Left
dfs(grid, row + 1, col)  # Down
dfs(grid, row, col + 1)  # Right
```

Order doesn't matter - all 4 directions must be explored.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing boundary checks**: Accessing `grid[-1][0]` or `grid[m][n]`
2. **Not marking visited**: Infinite recursion if cells aren't marked
3. **Wrong character comparison**: Using `1` instead of `'1'` (char vs int)
4. **Empty grid handling**: Not checking for empty grid
5. **Diagonal connections**: Checking 8 directions instead of 4

## Optimization Tips

1. **Early Exit**: Can add early exit if all cells processed
2. **Direction Array**: Use array for cleaner code:
   ```python
list[list[int>> dirs = \:\:-1,0\, \:1,0\, \:0,-1\, \:0,1\\
for dir in dirs:
    dfs(grid, row + dir[0], col + dir[1])

```

## DFS vs BFS Choice

### When to Use DFS

- **Pros**: 
  - Simpler recursive implementation
  - Natural for tree-like exploration
  - Less code
  
- **Cons**:
  - O(m×n) recursion stack in worst case
  - Stack overflow risk for very large grids

### When to Use BFS

- **Pros**:
  - O(min(m,n)) space for queue
  - No stack overflow risk
  - Better for wide islands
  
- **Cons**:
  - More verbose code
  - Requires queue data structure

**Recommendation**: DFS is preferred for this problem due to simplicity, unless dealing with very large grids.

## Why In-Place Marking Works

1. **No Extra Memory**: Saves O(m×n) space
2. **Simple Check**: `grid[i][j] != '1'` handles both water and visited
3. **Permanent Marking**: Once marked, never needs to be revisited
4. **Grid Modification**: Problem allows modifying input grid
